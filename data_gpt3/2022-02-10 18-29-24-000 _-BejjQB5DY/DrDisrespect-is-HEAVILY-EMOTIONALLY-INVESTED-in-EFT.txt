 Ah, nothing like stepping outside of the arena doing some dynamic stretches. Oh fuck. Let's get back inside of the arena. You thought I was jumping right to the command center wrong. I'm stopping by the Turtle Beach lounge. Where obviously it's jam-packed. Are we open yet? We're obviously it's jam-packed. People drinking drinks and eating burritos de carne asada. Lots of music blasting around here and it's... popping. Lupo, pull! Whoa. I know. Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh! Man, I wish I could do that. Hmm. The man's voice is shot, Doc. Uh-oh. There's gonna be a puberty stream for me today. Okay. Is that you? Yes, I'm shooting down the lane. Holy shit. Sorry, sorry. Yeah, you didn't want to sit in that right side room. He ran across a little shit. Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Hey! I got him 80s into that thing that just whiffed right by your helmet. I know, I know. Fuckin' bled, you fucks! Shit, he's coming around the back of the car. Yup, I'm gonna go ahead and move so I don't get caught. Get him, bled! He's right here at the bottom of the stairs. It hit the rail, no way. Nope, he's still alive. He's coughing up a storm, though. He's trying to shoot me. He took an arm off. Ugh! Boy, you're real quiet, aren't ya? You're real quiet, aren't ya? How about I open this door up? Fuck. I'm the back. You made a mistake! Boom! Boom! I misjudged the shotgun slug capability? Oh, they're strong in this game? I mean, I guess, but... I didn't ADS them. I just kinda hip-fired them. I might have been off. My centering might have been off. No, you know what happened? Your gun jammed. You got a stovepipe. No! Yeah, you got a stovepipe. It's sticking out of the gun right now. The round is literally hanging out of the ejection board. So you probably shot, and then you couldn't shoot a second time. Oh... There's a gun jammed. Is this a scav shotgun? It is. It was just a low-budget run. Just to go into factory. I hit this guy like six times! Did you get him? Yeah, he's dead. Okay, coming in. The front? Yeah. You're on the rocks, still, yeah? Holy shit! Now I'm dead. That guy killed you? Yeah. Wait, who's running down the road? I'm not. I'm gone. I didn't just kill you, did I? Ho ho ho ho ho. Ah, no. Did you kill Doc? I hope not. No, no, no. I don't like that you asked Doc if you killed him and he just started laughing. I don't like that. I got a little nervous there for a sec. Ah! You good? I'm dead. I can physically see you? Okay. I'm dead. I can literally see you. Oh. You tempt us! Uh oh. I don't think you're dead. I think you're right there. Da da da da da da da da. Oh shit. Hey, so, uh... Are you David Blaine? Because you just disappeared in some smoke. Welcome to the magic show. I'm good. I'm just up over here. Hey. I think I'm gonna hug this wall. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. My screen is just a blur right now. It's like the Batwing. The Batwing? Yeah, the back of this MK, or whatever this thing is called. MK-47. The mutant, yeah. Oh, the stock that you have on it, it's one of the wireframe ones. You got a blue, uh... Yes, yes I do. Good call on that. He ripped my arm off. I got a lot. Did he have a blue light on that? Yeah, he did. He had double blue lasers. Dude, I saw it and I immediately started strafing into the trees. And then that's when I started asking you. I thought honestly at first that that was your blue laser. He took his headset, yeah? Uh, no. Do you need it? I mean anything you're not gonna take, I'll take. Yeah, go back, go back. You can have it. I mean, we're digging deep into the... Another one! I don't see you. Fuck outta here. Yo, what the fuck? Where was that guy? I couldn't tell you. Confirmed, it did not scare me either. If I watch a clip back of that afterwards... No, you're gonna see smooth dock operating, man. In fact, you're probably gonna be super impressed by the reflexes. Alright. Chad, give me a clip. I wanna see this. How much loot do you guys have? Cause I want it all. You trying to take my gear? Yeah, the two-time back-to-back is going to take your gear. No the fuck you ain't, mother fucker. I'll let you go ahead and try. I think he's got a buddy though. One's dead. I still think there's a guy to my right. I think there's still another one. Cause he was talking to somebody, right? Yep. You good? Now you're gonna die! Got him. He's dead. Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, the champions club. Still alive? The entire world has felt its presence. No, I'm dead. But only a slight few will feel the silky smooth power of the black on black slate black blaze. So, just a little grenade. I'm running a commercial. What's going on around here? You shut your mouth, mother fucker. When you step into a game of escape from Tarkov, sometimes you step in a world of isolation. You step in a world of isolation. You step in a world of isolation. You step in a world of isolation. You step in a world of isolation. You step in a world of isolation. You step in a world of isolation. I'm loving these escape from Tarkov. Like, it's, it's... I like this sort of build up, mature approach. Get to load out. What tasks we got. Let's talk about what we need to do. Let's get in there and then boom! Once we're in there... That's when shit gets real, real, real. I wanna go... I wanna... 10 in a row today. Easy. Honestly, easy. I almost launched Battlegrounds. No way you... No way. Easily one of my favorite clips from recent times. The Halo match. Movement right. Hey, who's out there? This is my friend. If you didn't know before, he knows now. Guess you gotta be in range with the shotty. That's behind us. That was a BZ round. Somebody to my right. Directly right through this train. He's dead. I got a guy to my right. Coming in mid. He's on my side. I just got shotty. I'll push him. I gotta stop him bleeding. Alright, let's get it. How do you wanna do it? I wanna get up in the... You good? You just letting him know? Just letting him know we're on our way. We're swinging right, right? We're swinging right, yes sir. Roof? Yeah, maybe roof. Got one. That's him. Oh shit! I got one. Damn, he doesn't mess around, huh? Nope. That's Bluehar. So he's got one guy in front of him. I took one of his guys down. This guy's dead. I think you got shot in the head. There's a bullet hole in your helmet. Yeah, I did. I'm chugging a nade deep outside. I'm looting. Of course. Searching a box. Did you hear that guy? What the fuck? Another guard, he's dead. How many guards are there? I don't know. I don't know. How many guards are there? Six. You can have six, yeah. Alright, we got some goodies. Alright, we good? I think they're all dead now. I hope so. Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go! Do I gotta wait here to jump? No, climb on. You just walk on. Holy last second. Plenty of time, huh? We came out of there hefty. Doc, how much did you weigh at the end? I don't know. I didn't check. Come on baby, let's go! Raiders here, raiders here, raiders here. I'm gonna be completely useless with this. Upstairs or downstairs? We're down. Got it. One's dead. Oh shit. Guy on the stairs, I can't get him now. He's got advantage on me. I'm looking stairs. He's on the stairs right now. Oh god, you're such a pansy, man. You're such a pansy. Come up here, you pansy. No, you come down here, you pansy. Keep him there. Keep him talking. Come on, I hear you. I hear you strafing. No, no, no, I hear you. Look at you, man. Run away! Keep him talking. No, we're not leaving. We're gonna give you an opportunity. Come on. Let's just fight it out. He's still up there now. Well now you're gonna get trapped. So you gotta make a decision. He's still up there. He's scared. Who fired, huh? I am not still up there. You're not still up here. I can't believe how pathetic you are. Because the guy holding the corner down there. Because the guy holding the corner down there. Whoa! Come on, nobody's holding anything. I don't trust Doc. He's definitely gonna shoot me. You don't trust Doc? No! Come on, that's not me. He's coming. He's coming, Doc. You see? Just come right up. There you go. I didn't even shoot him. I didn't shoot. That wasn't me. Was that you? One's dead. Jesus, Lupo. Are you going all the way around the map? I'm working on it. There's audio, Doc. I died. I just waited in the corner. I couldn't hear him. I said there's five of them and then another guy fighting. It takes five of you, huh? It takes five of you, huh? And none of you have the guts to push down. It's pathetic, man. What do you think about just pushing away? Yeah, we can do that. That's why you're a Jasper. Fuck it with me! I got one guy. Let's just go. I'm about to fight this shit. Hold on a minute. Let's go turn power on. I want to kill these guys, though. Oh no, raiders are here. Oh no. Hurts, doesn't it? Now you're going to fucking die. Where are you? Oh god, your armor's... Doc, what about you? Do you have tasks you gotta do somewhere? I'm looking at them right now. Obtain the case containing the device on customs from the pharmacist task. That's 114. That's 114. That one's an easy one. I think he's just outside the left. Yeah. I'm pushing. I'm closing the door. Second floor. I ran out of bullets. I could kill this guy, though. Easy. He's going to die. He's dead. Fantastic. I was a sneaky little bastard. Level 28, man. Come on! I thought for a second I shot the... Alright, we got a task done. We got some keys, whatever. And we gotta use this dude. Locate and mark the first ambulance on our favorite map, shoreline. Shoreline! Pull! Yes! Let me go look over here on the beach. I'm kind of leaking to the right, so... Okay. Got a guy behind me. On me. He's literally one shot. Scab or PMC? Ah! Yeah, hit, hit, hit. Scab underneath the rock to the left. Oh, I see him. On the left or right. You want me to hit him? Yeah, go for it. Oh, crispy one tap. A big one! That was a good one. I got a guy to my left. Heard something. Sort of wood jump. Oh, yep. My 12 running away. Up the hill, going to the little shack. Yep, I see him. Where I... My clothesline shack? Another one down below. There's two? Yeah, there's two. They ran up against the wall. They're trying to get to the wall, coming into town. Yep, I got one guy up to my site. He's chucked a nade past me. I'm moving to you, Doc. Yeah, yeah. Okay, if you can stay right there. I'm in between them. They don't know I'm in here. I got a guy to my left, and I got a guy in this house. Is that a bad guy? That's Doc shooting him, I think. He's in that... Yeah, or he's on the outside, actually. Yeah, he's on the outside of this wall. Shotted nade. There's one towards the brick. There's a large brick house. Got two down. You got him? Okay. How come you guys get action, but not me? How come Doc gets two kills, but not me? Okay. Huh? Huh, Doc? How come? Ahhhh! Come on! Suffocate! That's gonna be the keyword, okay? Like, if we hear somebody, we have a little proximity chat, this and that. When I scream suffocate, I think we go all in. Just start W-king. I'm 100% on board. Okay. Uh, there's... Oh, shit! Yeah, second floor, by the bridge. He just shot at me. Jesus! Look at you! Get him! Boom, boom! I love that. Is he dead? I don't know. I sprayed the wall down there a lot, where he might have hid in the corner. I want to go kill these guys. Maybe somebody in two-story? Because I didn't... or in admin? Because I didn't hear that. Who's this? Shoot him. I'm on the roof. I'm on the roof. Is this you? Am I looking at you, Lupo? Fuck, there's another one, man. So I'm on the third, and I wanted to get aggressive. I jumped through that crack. I land. Right when I land, this guy's like kind of... He's coming from that staircase, and strafes, and looks right at me. And I was trying to get... He saw you were his teammate. Yes, and so, once I clarify with you guys, I killed him, and his buddy shot me from behind. So I literally jumped down in between both of them. And he thought, I was his buddy. Oh my god. I should have read that too, though. That's insane. Hey, bro, I heard you inside. I just wanted to find out... Are you inside there? I thought I heard you. That was me. Oh, there it is. I thought I had a similar voice to you. He's under me. I'm not, bro. Can I hear you talk? I think we have the same voice. I think we have the same voice, don't you think? What do you mean? Like, we sound the exact same, don't you think? Like, IRL Boop-a-cords? Yeah, like, like, tone-wise. Oh, okay. Do I have any steroids? Uh, here, I got you. I've never used any of those before. I mean, in the game. Oh, uh... Boop-a! Boop-a! Hey, Boop-a! Boop-a! Look what I forgot! Look what I found right here! It's a Christmas ornament. It's a Christmas ornament. It's my logo. I don't know how much this sings worth. Boop-a! Boop-a! Boop-a! Boop-a! Look what I found! Look what I found! It's a desk lamp, but it lights up in my logo. I don't know if I have enough space. My TAC rig. Need some help with that guy, or? You need some help, or? You know what? I think I'm just gonna let that guy live. Alright, I think he deserves a live. I think you just earned it. The repair on that might be expensive if it's damaged. If it's too much, don't worry about it. 30.1 out of 54. Okay, if it's... Yeah, how much does it cost to repair that? Ensure 47,444. Don't worry about it. That's the wire right now. Yeah, don't worry about it. No, man! Boom! I'm done. You got it? Okay. Oh no, I ensured it for 47... Fuck, man. No! I'm gonna be honest. Hello? Hi. Guy in the truck. Hi. Just a friendly scav. You're a scav too, yeah? You're not a scav? Huh? Alright, alright. I won't kill you. You're talking about the two-time! Hey, you wanna go clear dorms? Yeah, let's go, baby. Hey, you wanna know something funny? At work today, I was watching yours in the... Lupo stream. Where you working? That allows you to watch the two-time in Lupo. In front of millions. It was like during lunch. CBP officer. In Port of Long Beach. Okay. Alright, before we go in here, I want high-level comms. We remind them that we're way better, okay? Way better. That's what he gets. Come on, dude. You gonna shoot me? Come on! Hello, hello, hello! I'm innocent. We got 17 minutes. All of us in here. I mean, we might as well just stick together and just absolutely destroy the rest of the lobby. Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! I don't trust it. Something's weird going on out there, you know what I mean? And I can't figure it out. Hi there. Hi there. Scav? Hi there. This game's a trip, man. This game's a fucking trip.
