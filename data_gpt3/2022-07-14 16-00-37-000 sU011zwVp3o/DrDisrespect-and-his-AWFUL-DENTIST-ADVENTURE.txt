Let's go! 18 kills solo on that map. That's not bad champs. We're in full control too. Doc check out Robocop Rogue City trailer. Alright I'm gonna do that. The aesthetic of Robocop could look so good in like a next generation engine you know like the Unreal Engine 5 the way the metal reflects and shit especially like if it's in first-person mode and you see his arm and the metals like that. Hold on let me check out some of these screenshots. I'm always like we're getting to the point where we need next-generation environmental art. We'll watch the trailer and maybe we'll go back to some of these shots. Dead or alive you are coming with me. What the hell? I mean it looks like it could be fun. You know? I'm slapping you right in the face. Hey how about you? Where am I? Where am I? Can't hear you. Behind us! Not even close. Oh this guy's dead. Let me handle it. Oh see? Let me handle it. Oh baby. That's what I like to hear. I'm literally stuck in a wall garbage. Guy goes right through my body. No no no no no no no no. That loadout was too hot. Full screen mute. Full screen mute it. Yeah we like the storage Timmy. Sorry Timmy we're sorry to disappoint you. This is one of these lobbies. Guaranteed 100%. This is fantastic. Good news. Let's go. I thought I heard you earlier. I don't want these guys to push up on me right now. I could probably kill them with this angle. Oh god see ya. I'll be right back. Why do people got Christmas lights on my street? Doesn't that mean? I cannot see these dudes man. I'm good here. They have air strikes non-stop. Look what they're doing. These guys are fucking weird. And it kills me through the building. It's the same team that at the very beginning of the game. They're like oh it's them it's them. I know they're trying their hardest. We're going to stay alive all the way to the end of the game. And we're going to all carry an air strike each. All three of us. Well that's what happens when you only have three viewers. You're going to be doing these type of things you know. Yeah throw the teddy bear. Throw the teddy bear. Good toss. But you're a 45 year old man. What are you doing with a teddy bear? Get the fuck out of here. Champs it's reality check season. On the main stage in front of the brightest LED lights imaginable. The two time. The two ton. And Z are going to win a game. In Warzone. Today. Starting right now. In 30 seconds. Don't get lost in the south doc. I had to get a root canal. And this was like the biggest process that I had ever gone through in my life. I mean you talk about like consultation and then this next level of like they're putting these like colorful pins in my gums. And it's a I'm put to sleep. It's like a six seven hour ordeal. You know. And then come back check it out like it was just. As a kid you didn't want to go through something like that you know what I mean. So anyways I never liked Dennis. Because of that. Or at least going through the process of doing your checkups and whatever. Anyways I knew I had to get a root canal. This my gums were just like the tooth. You guys remember me talking about it especially on stream like it just went dead. It was super painful for like four or five days. I'm talking sharp pain and then it just died out. So I got to thinking like maybe it was just some food stuck to a nerve and it was just really bad and I couldn't get it out. You know but the pain is gone I don't have to worry about it now. Over the course of the past couple of months it's gotten inflamed. And I know it's like bacteria is kind of. So anyways I made an appointment to go check it out yesterday. An appointment. A specialist. I go in there and sit down you know. The whole intro phylacteria you know whatever. And then you sit in the chair and then the dentist comes. We talk we take some x-rays and he talks about the situation that's happening. And very clear like awesome. He's like so what do you think? And I'm like yeah it makes sense to me. He's like alright we'll begin. I said okay. He sticks a couple needles in my gums. Nums them up. I'm sitting there for like 10-15 minutes. Comes back he's got like this microscope system. And he puts this thing over my mouth this rubber. And he's in there with this microscope looking in my mouth. I was in that chair for like 25 minutes. Total office time maybe 45 minutes champs. And I'm out of there root canal done. I couldn't believe it man. I want to go to the dentist now all the time. Just take care of everything. Just always constantly take care of my teeth please. I'll go every day. You going back for a crown. So that's the second part. So that was the first part. First part is they go in there they clean it out right. And then they put like the medicine in there. And then there's a cleaning out process and a healing process. And you come back in a couple weeks. And they go in there and they just touch it up. And then you know depending on the type that you had. I don't think I need a crown. They went with a drill hole. So I don't know what they need to do to fill it back in. Once they need to do what they need to do. I was pretty impressed. But I went to a specialist. I didn't go to like my main dentist. And I think that was the key. Because these are the people that have all the newest equipment right. And this is what they specialize in. It was kind of crazy because I heard someone next to me. And then another person to my left kind of having certain same symptoms. And he just determines like you know based off. It was like an assembly line. He has the process dialed in. If you're thinking about it. I mean that's you know if it's costing. Let's just say if you throw a rough estimate out. Total treatment. And they had me. Someone next to me. Another person to my left. And I'm hearing these conversations. Because it's kind of an open room vibe. You know. Instead of sectioned off in individual rooms. It's kind of open room. But like there's dividers. So I'm hearing all these conversations. And this guy's. They're making the determination. He's really smart. I like there's. You know. He had different feedback. It was all very specialized. But man you talk about like. See. If he's knocking out three or four people at like. Depending on the severity of the situation. Let's say like two thousand. A pop. Per hour. He's making some pretty good money man. I'll tell you when I was a kid. That thing. It was horrific. I did not want. I ever ever want something like that again. That's why I was pushing this one out man. Let's just be honest. That's what I was really doing. I was pushing it. I was ignoring it. I'm like fuck it. I don't want to go through this. Just push it back. Just continue to push it back. That's what I was doing. That's what I was doing.
