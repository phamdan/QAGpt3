 I'm landing right there, I'm going through the glass, I'm getting cash, I'm looking good, ponytail slapping, shoulder blades ripped. I'm already ready to push a team. Hahaha. That's because you're a savage like that. If we win this game, I'll send you some gear. You'll send me some gear? Some rocket gear, I'm talking mouse, keyboard. Top of the line. Oh wow. Heard. So let me put on my A-game then. Okay. I'm gonna need you to focus in. You're right. I'm hitting dead silence. Oh, he's on top step. Right in the middle. Shit. Take the fuck. Get this guy. There you go, baby. Oh, I thought you got this guy. He's low, he's low. Push him. No, no, no. Sort now or capture the... Come on! Stand by for a moment. Woo! Shit. That's fine, that's fine. Now stick around, level. I'll get you up. Stick around. Finish the job. Get comfortable. Right? If you need to go get a little bottle of milk so that she calms down just a little bit in the background, that's fine. But I am gonna get you up. I am gonna kill this guy first. Oh, I love it, I love it. Why quit, you know? Right. Just simply give up. Enemy soldier incoming. Bring him in. That's what I want right there. Good hit, good hit. Oh. Yeah, you like that, huh? You thought, oh, is this gonna drop off? Yes, yes. Nice. What about that sniper behind you two? This is his buddy. Look at this guy. Let me take a look. Oh, I went down. Darn it, I shouldn't have looked. Oh, God, I'm almost dead. Now this other guy's about to get psyched out because now we got dead silence on him. Yeah, yeah. I hear him running though. Oh, shit. Look how pathetic. Huh? Pathetic, right? One guy. No! What? We lost that one. I missed my shot, man. Oh. How? I don't wanna get that, man. You hit him though. Dead on. Alright, LevelBars, we'll see you, huh? GG's, man. GG's. Oh, Champions Club members, Doc. Thought he clicked on his mouse and it just didn't fire the shotgun at that exact same time. Luckily, he's got millions of rocket burst pros sitting in his backpack. And it's not a Gucci backpack, trust me. But that is... Where's my music? Doc, why do I have diarrhea but not you? Trust me, I've got diarrhea. I don't know what you're saying. What's good, dude? Oh, boy, I'm feeling real good. Yo, check out this. My PBS teammate, um, he killed me in the lag, dude. Oh, was it? Yeah. He got my way, you know what I mean? I got a guy. Did you watch the finals last night? I did. Can't stop this. I'm being honest, man. You could just... Nothing Phoenix could do. Nothing. Yeah. Yeah. I know, it's honestly ridiculous. So get this, I made a bet with my manager at work. He wanted the Suns to win, and he thought they were. So I knew... Fuck, I knew the Bucks were gonna win and all that stuff. So... Oh. There's more landing. There's more landing. So don't feel bad. Fuck. Contact, contact. And, uh... And yeah, so we bet a meal for... I don't have time to chit chat. I don't. Ready to win? Hello. What's up? What was that in the background? It was this video of the, like a Russian fighter jet. Can you do a sound effect of it? A brusny, a brusny. No, no, no, of the actual jet fighter flying by on an airway. I'm sorry, right now, I can't. I'm not good enough. Hey, man, you're pretty good. You're pretty good. You ever thought about doing sound effects for video games? Yes. I also thought about designing maps for Call of Duty. That'd be kind of cool, huh? Oh, really? Yeah, imagine making like a map like Solar. You ever played Solar on Advanced Warfare? I have. I mean, how good is that map, though? It's pretty good. I'm not gonna lie. It's probably one of the best in the franchise. True, true, true. I actually want to win. Let's do it. All the way to the finish line. Yeah, finish line, minimum. Two guys are already landing there. You got a ponytail? Uh, nope. Our first kill needs to be a 360, minimum. All right. I get it. The 1993-94 Blockbuster video game. Okay, my identity's gone. You know who it is. Yeah, we gotta get involved. Woo! Oh, shit. That's a lot of gunfire. All right, all right. Guy behind us. Guy outside. Yep. Nice. One at a time! All right, let's wake up. Let's get in it. Oh, they got me. Aw, damn. Well, it was nice playing with you, Doc. Nice playing with you. All right, no fat chicks. All righty. Peace. All right, let's get it. They're always a little curious, huh? Come on, champs. They're always a little curious. The key to it all, though, is getting them real curious. That's the difference. And that's a freebie. Here's something. They're interested, but they're still looting, right? Shoot a couple shots. Where did it come from? Let me open the door. Oh, fuck. Not a... Definitely not a bot, you guys. I don't have bots in duos. I've confirmed it. I don't know what this rotation looks like. Ooh. I think that might be the mark to come inside that compound on the left side. That's a tough push, man. All right, we got to ride this ridge. I was going to wrap. That's where I want to go, right there. And then I come into that path. I arrive at that compound. Looking real good. Try to rotate to the other side. I think that's the move, champ. We want to win this. Let them fight. All right. Fuck, man, I'm dead. I'm dead. Not yet. You over here. This guy put down, he knocked one down. This guy's still sniping. This guy's still shooting at him. We got one. One knocked. And we got this guy. I got to push this guy. I got to be aggressive with this guy right here. I'm going to push this guy. I'm going to push this guy. Unfortunately, doctors little teammate didn't want to stick around and win some incredible rocket gear. We're jumping into some apex duos. Let's just see if doc and find the right teammate. It's the diggy, diggy doc. Hello. GG. This game is like every fiction ever thought of in sci-fi combined together. The comics from total recall. These from like a combination of Jurassic Park and and I don't know avatar. The ship design event horizon. We got a guy across in front of us Marsh, you know, Martian starring Matt Damon. Melted by the volcano from from them from one of the alien from from Mithias. Hook shake. Welcome to the Champions Club. I'm starting this the game starting to click just every each time each moment I'm in this. It's clicking. Everybody knew it was only a matter of time. Oh, man. Yeah, yeah, I got one right area. Oh, that got this guy's exploded his old. Damn exploded to. He's pushing me. I'm dead. Just shooting shields crack one guy I got I got I got I like this just nothing like cracking to and then having to sit there and fucking watch them heal and then go to the next fucking guy. So I don't like this game. I hate this game. It's boring shooting shields. I don't like it. But a full spray and the fucking clip is never enough to knock a guy. Right. That's why no one wants to watch this game competitively. Nobody wants to know you can't create a without one shot. Right. That one. That's why I didn't do good in in e-sports. No one wants to watch it at the end. Everyone's camping out put bubble shields on camping doors going like this. Open it close it open it and fucking close it just to shoot someone's purple or gold shield twice. Right. And then just have the gas kill. I just don't know man. I don't know. This game gets me like I want to cry right now because I get so emotional. I'm literally crying right now. I'm literally crying right now. Because this game fucking pisses me off. It does. And you could call me a crybaby. I don't care what you say. But the game fucking pisses me off mom. Hey look at look at these guys. They don't have much experience. All right. They don't have much experience. I need you to have the experience on this team Ender. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to relinquish my ability to be the captain and lead us off the dropship and I'm giving it to you. I need you to take charge take full control and lead us. I'm not sure I'm the guy for that. I'm not sure I'm the guy for that.
