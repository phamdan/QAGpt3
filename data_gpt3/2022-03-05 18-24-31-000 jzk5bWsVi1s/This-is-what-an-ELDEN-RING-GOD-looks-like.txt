 We're jumping back on Elden Ring. Super duper easy castles and dungeons await us. First thing you do is you stop by the Champions Club locker room. Two fingers deep into the jar of Vaseline. When's the last time you've got a little workout in, did some dynamic stretching. Today! Good job. When's the last time you've... She wasn't important right? She only sells spells to learn. Oh okay. Yeah then what the hell. Not a big deal. Alright let's go to a new area. Let's continue onward. Hmm. I can go back to that dude and buy a stone keys. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna buy one of these stone sword keys if you don't mind. Appreciate it. What's inside? Easy one. I feel like this guy's easy. Let me get my... let me get my... God my mechanics suck. This guy's actually pretty easy. I can throw your shield up! Come on man! Hey Doc, big sword you've got there. Can you hold it with both hands? Just curious. Yes I can. Easy read. Easy easy monster design. I mean it's just... Oh God what is this? You know? I've never seen that one. Oh shit I didn't think I had any more flask. No! Back up! Damn that was the one. I didn't know I had one more flask. How come nobody told me? What are you guys doing? You know? These guys are just gonna sit there and watch. Just sit there and watch me do all the work. Got it. Alright I just feel like my whole attack situation just leveled up big time. This is a big time growing experience. This is an experience. You are watching the two-time become the legend. I'd sit in a beanbag for hours and hours and hours at a time making sure I had the fastest lap in virtual racing. Making sure Sean Kemp, Gary Payton, they were dialed in. Absolute perfect start. I made sure Sonic the Hedgehog got all the rings in the fastest amount of time. I was prepared and in this next run champs... right here, right behind me. I'm putting a personalized guarantee defeat of this boss. Absolute perfect start. Absolute perfect. Boom! Let's go! Oh come on man. This guy's pretty sick. Just holding up that bow and arrow huh? Oh man. Easy. Is my dude kind of getting buff? He's actually pretty nice for his level huh? And obviously the person managing him. Tim Lestas for the beach at least. I know you'll take care of us in the Champions Club says Bear with a $5 donation. Timmy is already... he's done? Timmy said see ya? That's what the Caldera will do to you. You know I think Tim would have a good time in Elden Ring. I gotta say I think he would have a good time. I think what he needs to do. I think what Timmy needs to do. That's just my recommendation for the two-time back-to-back 1993-94 video gaming fucking GOD! I think he just needs to put Warzone Call of Duty down just for a little bit and jump jump on this game. It's a nice little um it's a nice it feels like I'm the more I'm playing it the more I'm liking it. Oh baby baby baby baby baby baby the Champions Club. I don't like the fact that this thing is not spawning with a lever. Hate it. I think what we do when we get to the top we press the lever so it goes back down right? Bring you back here. Fine that's fine. Let me fill you guys out. Come here. Let me fill you guys out. Hold on a second. Hold on. A whip! Gotta check this out. Hold on a sec. Back it up. Let's get this thing off here. I don't need it. I don't like the whip. It doesn't do anything. Alright boom! Dual wield it. Get this guy's Mada. This little guy? This little guy? What? Oh I wanted him first try. I could have easily got him first try. Damn. God I hate the controls in this game. I think the controls are terrible in this game. I got to be honest the game is awesome but I can't stand some of these controls. They're so weird. You deserve to fucking die. You still have to switch over to heels. You're such a pussy Doc. You're such a pussy. You're not thinking about anything. That's what you're not thinking about nothing. Don't tell me to press A three times. It's just driving me fucking nuts. Sometimes you need to just dial it back. Slow it down. Get a little bit more precise with your timing and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm putting a personalized guarantee. This is the fight right here. I Easy Easy back in your little box I Like the jellyfish meta that's a new meta I'm going the table of last grace if we could do something for our next journey. I'm gonna use I'm gonna go to last You know what this guy's going to this guy's gonna die And they do it again, it's my trigger it's broken it did it again It is fucking broken aren't you huh you're broken I we plugged in the PlayStation original scuff pro number one selling controller in the history of controllers and collectibles online Oh, yeah, then we come right up here.
