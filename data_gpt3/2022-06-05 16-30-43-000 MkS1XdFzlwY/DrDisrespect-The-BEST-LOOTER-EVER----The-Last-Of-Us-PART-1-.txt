 For my understanding, it's one of the greatest single player games of our generation. Always chirped about in the chat inside of the arena, Doc, you gotta try this game. You gotta play this game. Always chirping. How good are we feeling today? Build a fence around me or something? I do like my single player games every once in a while. And we're only gonna play ones that really either have a reputation or they just have a nice fit that I'd be interested in and it doesn't take fucking forever to complete or whatever. One of the best games ever created. A good story to follow from beginning to end. We're gonna be playing Last of Us. Last of Us. You wanna go outside? Let's go down into the dark house. We pick it up and maybe make a call? That's just a bloody nose. Where's daddy's car? Nah, put that shit in fucking reverse. Let's go. Get that shit in reverse right now, man. Hey, Tommy, wake up! Holy shit! How much gas we got, man? Let's get the fuck out of here, Tommy. It all started with Tommy right there, man. This is a... Last of Us is literally on Tommy. This whole story is because of Tommy. Move your hands, baby. I know, baby, I know. Listen to me. I know this hurts, baby. You're gonna be okay, baby. Stay with me. Please, please, please don't do this. Please, God. Fucking Tommy, man. 20 years later? I'm coming. So a recovering from the apocalypse world. That's the setting. I like it. Joel, give me a hand with this. Sure, I'll turn the TV on. Oh. I'll take it easy out there. Should I close it behind us or... I'll let you put it back. Come right over here. Let me do some dynamic stretching. Okay, just go for it. What are we looking for again? Gonna pop right up behind that desk. Yeah, I didn't think so. What the hell was that? I kind of want to just... Oh, shit. Okay. And then... Let me play the game. That's all I ask. I found an underground platform. Put a little more shoulder into it. There it is. Fear is the response to loud noises. Always stay composed. Always stay composed. Here comes the bottle. Should we wrap back on the other side? Peek your little head. Oh, that's a good shot. That's a good shot. How do you get that brick? Jesus! Look. What was the plan? Say that we deliver you to the Fireflies. What then? Whatever happened to me is the key to finding a vaccine. I'm liking the setup to this game already. Wanted to stop right there because you never know, maybe the two-time has diarrhea. How are you doing that? You're magical. That's impressive. You must be the cure. What an easy game, huh? Pretty much we get to the capital. That's the end of the game. And then part two. A lot of you guys said I needed two sessions to complete this game today. Look at this. We're almost all over. We're only three and a half hours in. Please like the video. Subscribe to my channel. This might be a world record. If someone has a time, anybody got a timer on them? This might be a world record. That's the guy from Game of Thrones. She's infected. Oh, Christ. Oops, right? Go! Just fucking go. Stay close to me. We have to move. Oh, man. But before we do, let's loot. Yeah, yeah. Let me just... I like looting. This is what the two-time does best. All right, we're just doing a little looting. If you don't... Hold on. Let me just open this up. Lots of loot over here. Lots of loot. Come here, Ellie. Come help me out. There you go. But hold on. Before we go, let's just make sure. A couple bow and arrows right here. Boom, boom, boom. See what Billy's saying. God damn. Infected showing up much too close to the church safe house. Looks like I'm gonna need to do another round of clearing out the weak spots in the fucking perimeter. No! Damn it, Bill. You all right? You all right? Yeah. Come on, you can do it. How are you standing on the ceiling? Here's some ammo. Oh, actually, I'm just tripping out. How am I floating? Damn it. Oh no. Gotta get in there. Come here, come here. Come here! Jesus. We're in! We're in! We're in! We're in! We're in! We're in! We're in! We're in! We're in! We're in! We're in! There's some gear I'm gonna need. It's on the other side of town. Now you help me go gather it, and maybe I can put something together that runs. Okay. So, why don't you fix one of these cars? Oh my go- do you want to fix one of these cars but not me? Here. Let's get on with it. Yeah, baby, let's go. Let's get on with it! Yeah, just one second. Let me just do exploration. You guys always are on a rush, man. Yeah, one second. Just loosened up a little bit. See what I'm saying? Guys are in a rush. You guys, just wait a second. I feel like we didn't really take a look at the area. I'd like to take a look, if you don't mind. I'll be right back. I'll clear. Get in there. Oh, shit. Let's go. Come on, guys. Just follow me. Watch this. Follow me, guys. Yeah, just follow me. Follow me. Don't come down this way. This way, guys. Right in through here. I'm gonna pick up this bottle, if you don't mind. Ah, take that. Follow me, guys. I got you. I got you. I got you. It was for you. Well, Bill, I doubt you'd ever find this note because you were too scared to ever make it to this part of town. But if for some reason you did, I want you to know I hated your guts. I grew tired of this shitty town and of your set in your ways attitude. I wanted more from life than this, and you could never give that. And that stupid battery you kept moaning about, I got it. I got it. But I guess you were right. Trying to leave this town will kill me. Still better than spending another fucking day with you. Good luck, Frank. Someone let Tommy drive. Someone let Tommy drive. Batteries drain, but cells are alive. Meaning? Meaning we push it, get it started, and the alternator will recharge the battery. Thinking you drive and we push. You should probably search the house. I'm sure there's more supplies. That's a good idea. Actually, a great idea. Let me just check this bag right here. Nope. Oh, there's a bat right there. I kind of want it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to pick this up real quick. Fuck. Desolation, isolation, retribution, deviation, the next level of meditation, initiation, saturation, and I'm not talking about the colors. We are trying to survive in the last of us right now. Ellie, the two time. The fuck's this guy's name? Anybody know his name? Nobody? Billy, we're escaping. Let's get back in there. Are we going to help him? Put your seatbelt on, Ellie. What about the guy? He ain't even hurt. Let me just go and loot real quick, if you don't mind. Check. Hold on. Well, let's go to this other door real quick. It don't matter. All right, let's collect our loot. I thought there was like more loot around here somewhere that I missed. I didn't really loot upstairs. Let's just see. Let me just loot real quick, if you don't mind. Loot up a little bit before we leave. Excuse me. If you don't mind. Easy. Let's just not even fight the guy, you know what I mean? Oh, that's how you switch shoulders, man. I was trying to figure out how to do that. All right. We knew that puddle was going to come into effect. There you are. I shot the hell out of that guy, huh? You did. Yeah, you sure did. Part one of our Last of Us full game playthrough. And so far, I'm enjoying it. Definitely story driven, very interactive experience in the sense of, I don't know, kind of action items in terms of grabbing items. And I like looting, finding your way around.
