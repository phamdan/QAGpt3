 We're jumping on Elden Ring. We ain't slowing down. R-Rush near ya, ya rab. Marra hai rush near! WAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH! Gotta control it, gotta control it. I got it, I got it, champs. Hold on now. Didn't you... didn't you... Controller S A S... Controller ASMR. Hi. This is Controller ASMR. So when you step to your gaming station, and you power on your monitor, and you tap your keyboard, and then pick up your controller, that's when you know it's gonna be a hell of a session. And then you press the right thumbstick like this. Maybe you even bless your controller like this. Give it a proper blessing. On line. Day 2. The Dallion. I'm gonna screenshot that and go ahead and frame it. Ok, today we are not gonna be doing the Elden Ring death counter. Why? Because I just don't... OHHHHHH CHAMPPSSSSS! Ok. Study sorcery. Do I get a discount if I... What if I come back to you? Ask you the same question. Ok, so we've already... Let's start it off hot, huh? It started off hot. There's no way! We're gonna do this a little bit different. We're gonna do this a little bit different. Let's get into my combat. Is this somebody I can take down right now, you think? Let's find out. Sit down! Just gotta circle this guy. That's it! Look at this! Is it this easy? Is this game this easy? Is this game this easy? He's, uh... I think we gotta circle him on the left side. Oh, man! Get outta there! Alright. I actually pressed some buttons wrong right there. Dude, I'm stuck! I'm fuckin' stuck! Jesus, you're not gonna let me escape, huh? Dude. I kinda wanna take this dude down. I think I can take him. My jellyfish didn't do anything! Dude. My jellyfish just sat there and went... Maybe I just forget it and continue on the fuckin' journey right up here, huh? Let's go that way. That guy's tough, man. What the hell? Oh, shit! Oh, is that right? Is this a boss? Damn! What about you over here? How did you see? Be wary of strong foe. Oh, shit! I gotta beat one of these guys today, like right now, you know? This guy's tough, huh? Alright. That was really successful. Whoa, look at this sheep! Nice move! Not good enough, but it's a nice move. We're going on a journey, champs. We don't know where we're going. Yeah, you know I wanna take this dude down. You know I wanna take him down, man! Get this guy, huh? That's bullshit! Dude, I'm out of stamina. Oh, you're going down, baby. One more of those, you're dead. You know it too, huh? Where you running to? We got you down now, buddy. Come on! Woo! Get out! There it is, baby! Come on, baby! Alright, I'm addicted to the game. Fuck, man. I'm pulled in. Literally pulled into the game. Look at that thing, man. Anybody seen that before? I like the scale of that thing. That's pretty cool. Alright. Let's try it again. Dude, stop fucking crouching, man. Oh my God. What the hell was that? The guy above? Oh, shit. Now you made a mistake! Made a mistake! Nice. There's the lever. Alright, let's go get this boss, man. Pass the time until morning time. Alright, come on, baby. What the hell was that? Oh, I should have done something right there. Alright, alright, alright. Dude. This guy's easy, actually. No! No, no, no, no, no! We had to commit. Oh, summon spirit of Lutil the headless. Yeah. Who's this guy? Man, that cost me 104. I can't even summon him. Eyes of a killer, man. Yeah! This game's actually kind of easy. What do you think? Take this guy down real quick? Easy? Let's do it. You're lucky, man. You're lucky. I jacked up my camera, man. Let me get it. I'm not able to. It's so horrible in this game. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go out. I'm taking this guy down. That's for sure. We're out of here, man. I don't even want to fight you anymore. I don't even think it's going to be worth it.
