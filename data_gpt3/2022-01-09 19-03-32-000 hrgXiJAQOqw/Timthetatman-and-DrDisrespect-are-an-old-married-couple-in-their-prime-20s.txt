 17-2 I'm in a good mood today. You know why? Because I'm looking over here. I don't see any dropped frames. I'm seeing such a smooth picture. And on that picture is me. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I thought you were only going to play Superhuman today. What are you doing? What happened? You texted me. Are you in like one of your scenes right now? No, I'm not. I'm right here. I thought, dude, I thought you were just going to play Superhuman. You want to play Warzone 2? I mean, no, if you got something lined up, I'm just hopping in. I'm kind of following you in the shadows. Spying on you a little bit. Okay, well, I don't want you to play by yourself. So I'm going to text Teeb in them. Why don't you spectate some solos, play with Teeb. Let me go ahead and get my solo win. Let me get me warmed up. No, let me know. No, because I like playing with you. No, you don't. What? That's why you had everything lined up with Teeb. No, I had it lined up because you said Superpeople and I said Warzone. And your exact response, I said I was going to start with Warzone. And your exact response to the text message was quote unquote Jesus Christ. That's what you said. How am I supposed to take that as let's play Warzone? HAHAHA Yeah, no, you made plans with Teeb and everything. So I'm just going to jump into some solos right now, Timmy. No, shut the fuck up. I am. No, I'm going to get a win. I'm going to get a win. No, you're not. You're not going to get a win. Definitely not. But you and I can get a win. We can do this. I'm playing on ADPing already, Timmy. How is that even possible when you're playing by yourself? I couldn't tell you. Other than everyone's active on the West Coast and we're in shape. This is approaching your position. Get to the safe zone. Is it your VPN, bro? Heads up, bags. Maybe. I'm coming in. It's fine. Teeb's fine. I was with him literally the other day. He's fine. Right now? Already? Yeah, I'm ready. I'm kind of still in my intro, Timmy. How is that possible? Actually, I thought you were booting Warzone up. Yeah, I'm getting out of this. He fucking... He shoots me with the pistol three times, Timmy. And I'm dead. Yeah. Doc, you didn't hide in the first game of the day we do in this, bro? What seems to be the issue? Well, what happens is... You're going to get liking a gunfight with someone. And then you're going to be like, oh, this guy knows. And then you're going to lose the gunfight. And then you're going to get mad. But ultimately, the only person to blame is yourself in that moment. And that's the only one that didn't hide your screen. Thoughts? Yeah, this dude's average at table tennis. Average. Well, that guy just landed right on you. This is kind of what I'm talking about. Oh, yeah, on me. Yeah, of course. You're going to have to get me up real fast. Is there precision on you? No, no, no. Fucking on you, bro. I'll start hiding my screen. I'm not. Give me the comms. Yeah, I got you. Right in front of me. Boom. Right side, right side. Left side, left side. Behind you. I was looking at it from a different perspective. I got confused. I got confused. That's on me. I literally three shot the right side of the screen. I literally three shot the right. That's my... It's on me. That one's on me. I literally read that one wrong. And that's a rarity, man. You know me in the call outs, Timmy. Dude. Let's win. Let's win. Calm down, man. I like pre-shot my right corner. No one's there. I get shot in my back. Hey, how you doing? Alright, hiding screen. Boom. Muting. Everything. Everything short of just shutting the stream off, basically. Is I think where we're at, right? Yeah. Or uninstalling. There was an other team in front of me that the fucking... That was a team. That was a team. That was a team. There was an other team in front of me that the fucking... That Bertha was just driving around me. Forever. Dude, I need to stop picking up those fucking containers. Did you really hide your screen? You know, I went full cam and then insta-cued. Like kind of fucking sort of things. I guess it really didn't matter. Yeah. So I guess I can accept some... Responsibility. Responsibility here. Well, at least you'll win this gulag. Well, coincidentally, That guy was apparently in our last game. I mean, who would have seen that one coming? Right? Man. Get ready for what I'm going to say after I win this. There you go. No way, Jose. No way. How about that? That was pretty creative. Welcome to the Champions Club. Hologaz, thank you for the 25. YouTube needs to step up their support for YouTube Live. Yeah. FWIZZ, HEY FWIZZ! Other than the big names, no streamers are getting any foot traffic. Making it hard for smaller streamers to get recognized. I'm going to go out on a limb. Pause the music. I'm going to make a statement right now, right? And if Jakey Poo is watching, I mean, hopefully he... There better be a huge segment on... I don't even know what he's doing. Don't tell me he's going to the LA Gorillaz, man. I agree, but it's pretty amazing. The champs, your support. I mean, the numbers have been insane. For a platform that literally has like no stream support or design that makes sense yet. Yet. I mean, I'm hoping they're working. I mean, this is Google, right? Anyways, let me go ahead and make a statement. You know what's interesting is like, how did Mixer go down? They got Shroud and Ninja over there, you know? They almost got me, but it just wasn't enough. I'm going to go ahead and make a statement. If we went over to Mixer champs, I'm talking to you, Champions Club and the 2Time, Mixer would still be around. I mean, the Champions Club doesn't fuck around. And the 2Time certainly doesn't. For what we're doing on YouTube with no algorithm being pushed forward, like Timmy. None of that stuff. We've been dominating, man. Problem is though, you're kind of just in the streaming space, you're kind of pushed in a corner. YouTube's not considered a streaming platform, right? It's a VOD platform. So you're kind of pushed into a corner a little bit. You know, in terms of the whole streaming community, because that's a lot of energy to be involved in that, right? And I think we've done a good job in maintaining a position within it from a social media standpoint. If we went to Mixer, it would have been Twitch versus Mixer. I feel like for a long time. And I think others would have came over and then all of a sudden, we're rocking and rolling, man. And then we're taking the streaming aspect of it and taking it to the next level. Like what the platform has in terms of their tool set and what they can offer communities and the interaction between the streamer and people in the chat. Like all these ideas and tools that I have a Microsoft Excel worksheet of. They would have been applied. What am I reading right now? Jake Sucky, my boy. He said that Doc has stated on stream that if he had gone to Mixer that it wouldn't be alive right now. Is that a fact? I think so, 100%. Okay, you got to be careful with zone, Doc. Yeah, I'm dead. What? I think I'm dead. Oh, brother. I'm dead. I don't understand. Like we had this top mountain play and you're jumping down there and you're fucking pushing up to this guy on the edge of the zone. Brother, that is on you. That's on you. I didn't even mean to jump off. I slipped off, but that's not even the point. I'm going to look at your chat for a second. Champions club. Okay. Talk to me about what Doc did at the end there because I couldn't fully see it. Hey, talk to him champ. And let him know. We had them dead under. We could have 100% just disengaged. Tim equals liability. Oh my God, Doc. You can't look me in the eyeballs and tell me that. Yeah, right. That's what this is. I'm just reading chat. Timmy sells so hard. Timmy sold. Oh, dude. I can't believe this, bro. I mean, it's pretty obvious, man. Even your chats going Timmy sold. That's a that's a non-member. There's two guys in play just flying around. Just. He smoked. He fucking gassed me on one. He's fucking one bullet. He gases me and I go to the stupid ass fucking amateur. Oh God, man. This stupid amateur design element. It's just I did this game is in its worst state that I've ever seen in my life. He's nice in this guy. One bullet. Update requires restart. They're bringing back for dancing. They're freaking. Apparently the 200 skin was fixed, boys, and Tim was using it. He's going to drop any fucking kills. How are you making fun? Dude, you're so afraid to make fun of Doc. It actually. Yeah, no, no, because because he knows he knows. Talk to him like that. Doc is not here today. No, he's not using this into. No, I'm definitely not. Definitely not. The whole time. Yeah. Tim already came over to the Champions Club over here and asked them a question. Everyone disagreed with his answer. Yeah, but to be fair, you could say two plus two seven Champions Clubs like fuck. Yeah, Doc. Right. And what would you say? Maybe like no dumbass exactly because they disagree with you. Right. See what I'm saying? They're not all just like now you just proved your point. Proved your point. They just disagree with you. It makes no sense what you're saying makes no sense. It makes sense to me. I got shot from behind. Dibb reloading. Where, where, where? I'm not going to tell you because I want to kill. Oh, OK. He's one shot. Oh, my. I'm not trying to. This is easy, easy. All day. Like this gunfight and general knowledge. Yeah. Wise. Exactly. And I'm not saying it's because we got you in here. That is what I'm not saying. I'm kind of thinking that's what it is. It's just an odd coincidence, you know. OK, I am not hosting this game, Tim. You know how the VPNs work. Yeah, you know how it works. What the fuck are you talking about, Tim? What are you talking about? I know how they work. What are you trying to imply with that statement, Tim? You Canadians are a little bit different. I saw Z-Leaders, Krodus. Oh, fuck.
