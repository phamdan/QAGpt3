Basically the two-time me I'm talking about me In fact, I canceled a meeting because I didn't want to talk to the phoniness I don't have time for fake people and all that shit.

It's in the blood they straight-up said The reason why is because I talk so much shit take a look around Around bunch of phonies man, because you're not a sellout. That's true. That's true. They do look for sellouts That's for sure. I've done it just because I passionately love the game and I ain't changing nothing I ain't changing how I feel what am I supposed to am I supposed to completely sell out my whole soul? I don't know man. I say how it is, right? I say it how it is when the games rocking and rolling man We loving it. We're loving it, right? We see progression we see where decisions are being made and we love a listen from a design standpoint from a gameplay standpoint From an IP standpoint call of duty's probably my number one ever But they got some new here's the thing though. They got some new PR marketing team or something I don't know some new team working over there, right and I just feel like they're clueless I do but I mean Am I affected not at all? Like I said, I canceled the meeting I I don't want to talk to the I had a meeting to talk to a PR guy and I said nah I already got all the information I need I said what I needed to say Out of there. See ya. That's where we're at. I Love it. Ah Joey carbone. Thank you for the five crazy. Isn't it crazy during the World Series of Warzone event? You should see how many people were talking shit about the game during their tournament during their event, right? I'm the scapegoat though and And I'm okay with that right? It's the two-time some people still don't get the two-time It's a lot of these young PR marketing people that are getting into Activision I mean you see the message going out yesterday the code of conduct that a full tweet The full Twitter thread if you like the same people that are running Activision are the same people running twitch It's it's like they're all the same. Huh? Is it me or they just kind of all the same? so the фак out of this game,daddy boy is using my It's very very clear Fontan I think that's健 for myHave toasted I'm for real it just you know, it somehow stays on my same surface But that's not the reason So bos bugs fucking In the cock Don't tell me. Don't even start my fucking day with this, doc. Just press the red. Shut up. Did I get you though? Did I get you? You didn't get shit on me. Yeah, I did, man. You're like, oh shit, you crashed. I know. Your shit probably didn't bleed. No, man. No. Trust me. Yeah. Damage check. What I will say though is this game is not a true full screen game. Oh my god. You're going to feel the charge run. Oh, there's one. Boom, cracked. Knocked a guy in zone. Oh, you're going to feel it. You're going to fucking feel it. Yeah, he's cracked. Large rifles. Right here, right here, right here.

Good for you then. Yeah. Okay. That's great. I mean, that's good. Yeah. I'm really happy for you. I guess the point that I'm making is how is there nothing else? That's like the right conversation you're having. Yeah, I know. I know. Check out the Gunsmith 2 video. How we designed Gunsmith 2.0 for Modern Warfare 2. Let's take a look. Here's this $100 million marketing budget. This is where it all is thrown in. Looks good. That's a good looking weapon too. We are introducing our system of how to develop or modify a blueprint like we've never done before. We wanted to create a weapon system that was visually consistent through and through. Infinity War is bringing it, huh? I like it. This is the game I've been waiting to make a long time. Pre-order now. Get early access to the open beta. I like it. Look at Timmy. I wonder how much worse the queue times get ranked once people begin to tune in and see we're playing. The people are like, oh shit, actually stop. Doc Nico encourages people to actually stop queuing. I have six batteries. It's quite enough. I have one, I would say. I'll take some. I have three. We got to really teach this guy, Doc. It's quite the opposite. What do you mean? I mean, more and more people queue when we play. You know what I mean? No, they get scared and they don't queue. No, no. They get excited. People get terrified. They have seven monitors. They're eliminated. No comment. No comment. You can't teach confidence. We all know. If COD doesn't exist, is streaming the same as it is today, says trailer park dude with the fight out of the nation? I think Call of Duty for me is embedded into my gaming soul. I don't know what else you could say, right? Does streaming exist? It's not a game. It's a game. It's a game. Does streaming exist? It certainly does, but man. I mean, you look at the options right now. If COD doesn't exist, it's literally Apex, Valorant, PUBG. But I mean, hey doc, how come you're the champion but not me? Kevin, welcome to the Champions Club.
