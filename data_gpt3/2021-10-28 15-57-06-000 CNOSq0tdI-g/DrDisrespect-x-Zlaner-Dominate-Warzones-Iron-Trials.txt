 Today we're getting dripping in heat and trust me we're gonna be dripping. I'm talking about Zlaner has returned and guess what? I'll still be fighting against controller players. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright, let's get the same kind of action going here again. I like what we just did. Got one of these guys broken. Yep. That guy's one shot. Oh baby, but this guy. Here, let me drop a plate for you. Right here on the corner. Just no chance. No chance. And he was a controller player. No. Above above on the top window glass glass. Oh, yeah. One shot shot. Doesn't know how to move. Another guy another guy on me. Oh and behind me. Give me some time. Give me some time. Got down one at the front down to give me all of them. Give me all of them. One shot. Holy shit right in front of me. Oh, the electricity today is something else. Holy the 60 round AK is nice. I feel like every gun off rip game mode is so good man. You can just almost grab your secondary class off rip and then just pick up one of these SMGs. You know what I mean? I'm going to be running restock today. If we end up hitting a second loadout, I'll grab restock, but I'll probably just be grabbing my overkill off rip to be honest with you. So you're not going to be touching ghost? And the reason being is that ghost is $6,000 and some teams will get it for sure. And we're going to be one of those teams that we're going to be grabbing a UAV off rip, but they just don't get popped as consistently as they do in the main game mode. Because you your health regenerates at such a slow slow pace. But when you have no plates on you still have a lot of health. And if you can hit that stimmy. Actually going to do that here in this game. I'm going to grab my restock. I'm going to pick up this MP5 and I'm just going to use the EM2 and I'll pick up someone else's second. I'm shot at. All the way at the top. Yeah desperate, huh? Right up here. I'm just going to stay in the fight. You go challenge don't really care. Right at the right the tree. Right at the right the tree. One on the corner on blue mark still. I got you. What she helps you worry break a few more rules. I think oh, I got you. I'm done. I'm dodging dodging right back here. Get right back here. Oh, yeah.
