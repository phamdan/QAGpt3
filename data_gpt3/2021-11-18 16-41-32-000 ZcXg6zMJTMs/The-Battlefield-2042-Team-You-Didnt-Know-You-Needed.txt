I got him pinned. I got him in a pincer. Long live the Tuk Tuk. No! No! Okay, you guys gotta go. Yeah, we gotta go. I'm dead. No. Doc, you should just focus on getting out because you have five minutes, bro. I'm not dead dead. I don't even know if Doc's gonna make it. More than two extractions, right? No, I think they said final extraction. I think this is it. And Doc, just so you know, bro, there is another team. Where? I don't know. Right there in that fucking jeep. I'm gonna tell you right now. Squad and players, squad and players. There's another team. There's one more team. It's 1v3. You just gotta go. Yeah, you gotta try and sneak onto the... Your best bet is to let them fight the AI and try to sneak on, literally. Or try and fight all three of them. Tim, can you watch them in first person or no? I can't. I can only watch her in first person. We're just counting on an L. That's gonna be an AI. They're honking. Oh my God. Oh my God! What? Hop in the back. Hop in the back. Hop in. You gotta kill them and then come on. Let's go, Doc. Oh my God. Come on, Doc. Four, three, two, one. Hey! Woo! Let's go! Oh my God. Wait, Doc, does it actually say you did it on your screen? Mission accomplished. I say we jump right into hazard zone. Fuck it. Unable to load, nice. Good. If this isn't working, we should turn off cross play. People keep saying it and I just don't believe them. Yeah, no, no, no. I did this with Sim earlier. We have to leave the party. You can't get a party and then turn off cross play. Well, I'm frozen now. Just unfreeze it. Okay. And then it'll work. Timmy's still in my party. I don't know what to do. Even when he leaves, it'll still... Okay, he's gone. Yeah, so you still have to hit social, Doc, and leave your party too, even though you're by yourself. Yep, leave party. Got it. Am I gonna have to leave even after I Alt-Tab four? Boom, invite. What do you mean Alt-Tab four? Cause you were gonna like leave, leave or what? I had to Alt-Tab four cause I was frozen. Doc, did you invite me? I don't see you on my list. Yeah, my graphics messed up again, bro. How do I fix this? I don't see you either. Settings? I think your origin settings don't let me add you or something, I don't know. Add friend. You're appearing offline. No, you're appearing offline. Change res back to 1920, 1080. I'm invisible right now, you know? All right, I'm online now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You see me? It was your fault the whole time. Well, no, cause you're also offline. So we're both offline. Doc, how do I turn off crossplay, Zach? Settings or hit accessibility, bottom left, the general, bottom general, just the crossplay. Tell Doc, turn off crossplay. He did not, my chat is yelling at me. I don't see crossplay. All the way at the bottom, but it's grayed out. Accessibility, so Doc, you need to go back to the social screen, leave your party. You should be at a party by yourself, you have to leave that party. Then once you leave that party, you won't be in a party. You'll then hit escape, go to accessibility, go to general, bottom left, you'll see other. Would you just join the party, Kurt? Crossplay should be on. Invite me again, Doc, I need an invite. Holy shit! Unknown error. It wouldn't let me join, dude. Wait, Doc, can you invite me, please? I think I'm in. I haven't gotten an invite from Doc. I've sent you multiple invites. All right, I joined off. There it is, there it is, there it is. We did it, guys! All right, here we go! All right, we're back in. Oh, here we go. Let's go, Timmy! All right, guys, I mean, I don't know what to tell you. Did it work? Full metal alchemist! So like, I have to spawn A1 here? I'm not doing it, I'm taking a fucking jet. Let's get up chat and going over. How the hell do you do this? I'll wait for one of you guys to jump out. For what it's worth, A1 has a lot of action right now, too. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Didn't sound like that went too well, Tim. Hey! It did not go up, bro! I couldn't go up, it just kept going down. Okay, whew! But it wouldn't let me go up, I swear. I was like moving my, I was trying to move my mouse up and it just didn't care. I was in the response screen and I'm following your little 2D jet all the way across the map. And when you jump in those, the jet light, it does this 360 spin. It's like, oh, that was perfect. Oh, that was perfect. Oh, that was perfect. Fourth tail out, okay, I guess I get 50 XP. Damn, we brought this back, this came back so hard, but I just don't.
