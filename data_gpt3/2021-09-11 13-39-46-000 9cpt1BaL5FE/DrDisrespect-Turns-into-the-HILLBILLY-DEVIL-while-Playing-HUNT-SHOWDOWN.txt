 You want coming to my yard, huh? Oh, now you're gonna die! Behind ya! Let's have some fun! This game getting scary! Ding-a-ling-a-ling! Come on in! I'll be waiting! Hahaha! You think you're safe? How come nobody told me about this game in the past? Not one single person from the Champions Club in the history of my incredibly illustrious career. Uh, many games where people are playing them. Hunt Showdown? I've been watching a lot of Summit1G play that game, and I've been asked to play Hunt Showdown... I can't tell you how many times, whether it was $4,000 donations at the gas station, I don't... I can't tell you how many times I've been asked to play Hunt Showdown. But after watching Summit play it, I'll catch C's a little bit too. Um... Hunt Showdown! Hunt Showdown! So the audio's good in this game, huh? Start training. You're about to enter training mode. Training gets you familiar with the controls! Mission flow and enemies in Hunt Showdown! The speed in a downsized version of a bounty hunt mission without fucking enemy players! Mission objectives! Locate the target and use the Dark Side to... Okay. Use Dark Side to investigate up to three clues. Clues will lead you to the butcher. To the butcher. Kill the target and once you discover its lair, prepare to take down the butcher. And then the boucher. As large and immune to fire, use axes to kill it faster. Once the butcher is dead, initiate the banishing ritual and defend the area. When the banishing is finished, pick up reward tokens from the corpse. Extract the bounty token. Take the bounty token to any of the three extraction points and escape with your reward. Is that pretty much what you have to do? I feel like this is a game best learned with a mentor. Landoram... Just watch the two-time do his thing. Oh shit! What the... Jesus! God! Jesus! Get the f***ing run! God damn it! Jesus! What the hell are these things? What the hell is going on? Holy shit! I'm like jumping right in like I know what I'm doing. I have no idea what's going on. You hear this guy right below you? Uh oh! Run! Okay so... Oh man! Not behind that tree! Right over... Oh shit! That was the guy that I heard man! F*** man! Why does this thing exist? YouTube what's going on today man? Listen! Good morning guys! Today I got a banger! Oh shit! I'm going to die! What the f*** is that? Okay that worked really well! Now it's time for this guy to go down. Jesus! Get the f*** out of here! Hector! Talk to me! I said Hector talk to me! Hector you got quiet didn't you? What the hell is going on in this place man? I feel like I'm at Gyro's house of terror or something. Oh you're by the tree huh? Hector why don't you show your face? I'm literally here to help you man! No no no no no no no no! No help right here! Don't need it! Oh really? Yeah! Oh okay! At last explain me like the basics to just get you off the ground. Okay that's what I'm here for literally. Beginners always join certain newbie servers. Though these servers are probably not even fully populated. It's for newbies to get off the ground a little bit better. Because otherwise well you probably wouldn't get first but others would. So um yeah I just like um feel free like if you want to. You see it happen it pops up on the screen so and so acquired the bounty. Most likely they're gonna try to get out. So I'm assuming you if you don't have a bounty those are the people you need to go and attack and kill before they get out. Am I? That's what I'm assuming. Hector see you're laughing I just ask him he's dead. I'm asking you champs. Howdy! Howdy! Howdy! Howdy! Howdy! Howdy! Let's have some fun! Hahaha! You want coming to my yard huh? Come on in! Woo!
