But I've got limited time, champs. Wow, wow, wow. Champs, I think I have my three winners. Our purpose is fulfilled. Y'all go and reverse. I don't know what you're saying. I can't. I think I gotta get the hell out of here. I'm okay with a little Doctober challenge from me as well. Challenge accepted. Challenge completed. I've picked my top three winners from the Doctober Contest. Oh, as you can see, it was an incredible showing. Millions and millions and millions felt the power of the two-time back-to-back. Oh boy, did they. Now let's go inside. Let's find out who won. And who goes into the gallery permanently. The real buzzin'! Lucas! And Vintage Clash. One, two, three. They had the guts. They had the vision, the dream. And boy, oh boy, did they succeed. Congratulations to all three of them. In fact, let's go ahead and head inside and review their work.

It's about to come out of my butt. I need to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. Oh, my God. Yeah, I get the speed. I get the momentum. But where's the violence? Ain't nothing violent about this 11 year old dog wannabe. Ding-a-ling! You're a little bit too much. I'm not a little bit too much. I'm not a little bit too much. I'm not a little bit too much. You think you're safe? October 2021, we're going back to back, baby. Almost! You came close. But congratulations. Third place after coming off of first place last year. I mean, to be in top three once again amongst all the millions that got involved. Congratulations to Vintage Class. Coming in at second place, Lucas Thorn. I mean, the artwork on the wall. The purple snake coming out of the building in 3D, gripping it. Timmy Tenders drinking his V8 juice and looking at his toy Jeep.

Appreciate everyone that participated, got involved. I hope you had fun with it. For those that drive real Lamborghinis, if you didn't roll up to the Halloween party in your real Lamborghini, I feel like that's a missed opportunity. But man, that was a lot of fun.
