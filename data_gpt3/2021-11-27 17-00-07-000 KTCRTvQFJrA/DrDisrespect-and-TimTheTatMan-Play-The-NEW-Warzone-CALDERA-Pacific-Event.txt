Do you ever look at time as in the length of movies? Like, for example, let's say you accidentally wake up early, and you've got two and a half hours, or maybe three hours until your appointment or whatever that you have to wake up. To me, I immediately think of, like, oh, that's the length of Braveheart. I have three hours. That's a long time, you know? Yeah. You ever do that? At least you don't have a time.
