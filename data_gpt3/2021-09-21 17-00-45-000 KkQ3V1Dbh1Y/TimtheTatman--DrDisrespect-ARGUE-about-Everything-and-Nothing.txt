 I feel like I'm wearing shorter shorts than you today. You're not. I have five inch in size. No, I will stand up right here in front of my camera. Like my shorts are definitely shorter than yours today. Like, I don't know how you can even get any shorter. Like my balls are a centimeter from slipping out, literally. Isn't it weird that I have better legs than you? Let me take a look. First off, you don't have better legs than me. Oh, look at that calf muscle. That's crazy. It's okay. It's okay. I have great, I have a great physique, right? It's actually not bad. Once you start shaping your physique, Timmy, but the knees, the inward knees right there, standing up. Inward knees? What are you talking about? Like they're kind of like go in a little bit. That's a clear sign. Athleticism and movement's going to be an issue. My knees don't go in. What are you talking about? Yeah, you do. Yeah. Your right one does. I don't think that's right. All right, let's get into it. All right. I'm ready. Did you hide your screen? I didn't. You didn't tell me anything about it. Doc, how long have we been in the industry? Have you ever played with Shroud? This guy, when I used to play with him, he never hid his screen. Well, Doc, I have news for you. You're not Shroud. What is that supposed to mean? What do you think it means? Shroud is extremely good at video games and you're you. No, what it means is that he had the guts to stay in it. And so do I. He has the ability and the guts. You just have the guts, which doesn't get you very far. I don't want to start the day off this way. This was our first game, literally. We can't start this way. All right. I apologize. You're a great player. I'm not the one that's putting us in a soft-ass duo's playlist. That was trios. Oh my God. I need coffee, Chad, if we're going to pop off today. I think I broke my hand. My hand hurts. Are you having a diva moment of some sort? I don't think it's so much of a diva moment. I just want my fucking Starbucks. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry. Here's 10 grand in that. He said, F off Timmy. Okay. Is it me or are these, I don't see any war zone pros getting these types of lobbies ever. Are you like, is it me or are these lobbies like, I mean, we're not playing a bunch of bots. That's for sure, Timmy. You notice that today? Yeah, my DNA is working. I mean, I don't know what else you want me to do. Do you want me to like, you want me to break the keyboard over my face just to press the space bar to open up my fucking parachute? Right here, right on. We're surviving. Bitch, you can stop. All I'm doing is surviving. I love you back here, Doc. This is fucking stupid ass fucking game. This game is so fucking terrible. I don't want to be stunned. I don't want to be stunned. I'm here with you. I'm here with you. There you go, baby. All right, let's wake up, Timmy. Holy shit. Fuck up. Damage check. Checked. I got another one knocked right in front of me. My guy's probably self-hung, the first one, right? Waypoint, mark. Sustaining fire. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Huh, Timmy? I'm literally jumping off. I'm jumping off. I think it's a floater, Doc. The guy's... How did you go down, Timmy? I don't fucking know, man. You just fucking... Oh, it's an AWP. You just tried to hit me, man. Sustaining fire. I got a gun. Did it win? Oh shit. I thought that was you. How's nobody ever gonna get out of this? I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. How's nobody at Raven Software going, wow. Maybe we should consider taking Dead Silence out, John. Yeah, Gulag approved. What's that, Sally? Yeah, keep the stun the same. John, what's the update? Absolutely, Dead Silence stays in. Marissa. What's that? Yes, aim assist. What's that? Hey, Fred, come on into my office. Fuck man, what are we doing over there? Raven. Doc, let's, maybe you and I just started a Valorant series, right? Where we go road to, from fucking gold to. Oh. Let's go then. I like that. Oh, it's tight, right? Oh, it's tight, right? Tight, right? Tight, right? I already got it. I already got the Nova. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. On, on, on, on, on. What the fuck, man? Oh my God, I have one health. I need to heal. Medic! It's CP. Fuck you. Spike down, B. Raina's back, sir. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Raina moved to garage. I got flank, I got flank. I got flank. Let me get the flank. Last player standing. No! One enemy remaining. I'm dying, I'm dying. Spike down. Go! Your duty is over. Oh no. Oh shit. Last player standing. Jesus. I mean, what the fuck are you doing? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'll show you what I'm doing, okay? I mean, you better either clutch or kick. You're in our fucking spawn. You better win this shit. Dead. One enemy remaining. Come on, let's go. Careful now. 10 seconds left. What are you saying, Timmy? We lost. Oh shit. You fucking idiot. Wait, that doesn't fucking, like killing their whole team doesn't matter? It doesn't matter if they're out of fucking time. Oh. I hate Valorant, a John Sherman. John, Johnny. No one fucking asked you, John. Get the fuck out of here, Johnny. Just get out, leave. Hop in your Jeep with the step and get the hell out of here, Johnny. Hey, Doc, what's up, bro? He's got one of those soft Jeeps though. Like it's like baby blue, the top's off, small, small tires. Got it. 30 seconds left. Doc, this thing's gonna trap you, bro. It's fine. Oh my God. Spike down, B. They're all hurt. Oh my God. Last player standing. Dude, that always, why did that one- Wait, what? Remaining. Spike planted. Like, I know I was gonna be trapped. No, no, no, no, no. We're playing team ball, Timmy. We're playing team ball, Timmy. Together, boys. Come on, fight together. Let's go. He's back corner, left corner, back left corner. Back left, back left. He's back left. Just went through it, just went through it. Running out. He's back left. Oh God. Oh, we got it. Where's the fucking clutch, Gene? So bad. Doc, I gotta go. All right, Timmy. Talk to you. Fun play, man. Fun games today. But, great day. See you. See you, Timmy. I'll see you. Have fun at the barbecue, bye. Hey guys, is this what I'm coming into today? That looks fucking awful. What are you guys doing? Doc, no- Yeah? Is this burst in the M16? No way, right? No, M16 traditionally across all of Call of Duty's before this one and maybe even Modern Warfare, were all burst M16s. Timmy, I wish you'd do a little bit of research before you step in here and start flapping the gums. That one is also a burst, Doc. I thought you just said it was an automatic. Are you high? What am I? Guys. Yes. What is he? What? Tim, are you and Doc fighting already? I just said that it was a burst. He asked if the M16 was a burst gun. And I said, why did he ask that? It's always been a burst. And then he went, he said to me that they've all traditionally been burst, Timmy, all through the Call of Duty history. And he goes, oh, I thought you said automatic. I don't know what he's talking about. It just, it felt like you were going down the direction of like, it was an automatic M16 and you're going to try to explain that to me or something. No, it's a burst weapon. That why, and so my thing was why, how do you not know that the M16 is a burst weapon? Because I believe in a previous Call of Duty, you could turn it from a burst to an automatic. Chad, can someone fact check him? I don't know if you could. I don't think you ever could. You think it's an M4, Doc? I think you could do burst in single fire. I don't think you've ever been able to fully automatic an M16. Well, I guess you never had third party applications installed on your computer then, huh? What? I got it confirmed here, by the way, the M16, there was one Call of Duty campaign that had a fully auto M16. You guys got to go do your research. It's only one, only one. That is legitimately shocking to me because the M16 is a burst fire weapon, isn't it? Yeah, I think of it. I don't think you can- I've never actively held an M16 in real life, but I believe that in every video game I've ever played the M16 has always been burst. Give me your favorite champs. Oh yeah, what the fuck? The hell, hey Timmy, what are you doing up here? Doc, you like my song? Which, well- Waffles are better than pancakes, dude. Waffles are better than pancakes. Waffles are better than pancakes. I said, I used to- Guys, you're still at Superstore. Guy might, not good enough, obviously. I can't wait. I'm in the front left. If someone zips up here, I will give them a hug the next time I see them. What? What? Doctor disrespect with one of my favorite friends. I got sniped in the face, it hurt. Bottom floor, sniping, look out. Doc, don't let him do this to me! Doc! Comes a shot. Oh! What? Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby. Oh, fuck off. Got a team on green, on green, right in the forest. If you get a knock, let me know, I got cluster. Oh! Got a knock, there it is. There it is. Wait, I don't know where though. Right there, boom. I downed one, apparently. Yep, that's the guy. That's the same guy. I don't think that- It's almost like you did it on purpose or something. Like you let him get up and then cluster late. Where did you knock him? Where did you knock him? Clear marker on exactly where the guy got knocked. That guy's self-pressing too, you gonna steal that one too, Tim? Yeah. Yeah, that's what he does. Another team rolled up, another team, another team. Oh my god! Waffles are literally designed to pocket the syrup to make it easier for more people to eat. And the butter. But I'm telling you, the majority of waffles will dominate pancakes, but there is that one or two percent of pancake that's just, to me, puts it over a waffle. I think that might be a friendly, but it also might not be. But also, like, might be your best fucking bet. Okay, dude. Okay, dude, we're gonna go. Knock him, dude. Then we're gonna beam to the other side. And then this will pass it down. How are you still alive? What's the matter, dude? I'm not dead. What's the matter, dude? Wow! That was impressive, actually. I ate you, bro. The hottest beyond, bro. The fact that you can live that long in that situation was truly incredible. I got moves that people, they're jealous, Tim. Doc, how do you have 81 damage and zero kill? Because I'm eating a salad with four eggs on it. Doc, I got a case of uncontrollable hot acidic diarrhea this morning. Do you suggest wet wipes or dry TP? Go with wet wipes. Actually, probably go with dry first. Just to kind of dab it, you know? Because the wet wipe, you don't want to spread it all over. And then it kind of, it's, I'd go dry and then into the wet to sort of really get that surface cleaning. And then go back in with the dry to really finish it off good. EST L 56
