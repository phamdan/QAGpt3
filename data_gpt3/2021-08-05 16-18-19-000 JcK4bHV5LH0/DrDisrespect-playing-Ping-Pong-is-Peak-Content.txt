 Alright, let's get to the Olympics Tokyo 2020. A dream is one. A dream is one. And that is true to come. And that is true to come. Our goal is one, one that is to be one. I don't even have my Wii controller. Do I need one? Anybody got an A? You got a Wii controller? You don't. Oh, it's mouse and keyboard. Got it. Athlete avatar editing. How far can we edit this guy? I mean, this is an extremely important aspect of the game. We might not even play the game today, champs. I got weird key bindings for everything, man. I feel like I'm in like a computer class taking C++ programming for the first time ever. There he is! Okay. I got no idea what I'm doing here. Hey Alex, do me a favor. How long was the echo on? The entire time. Stand up. Place fourth or above to move on to the semi-finals, baby. All right. Get them, Doc! Oh, I see. I see ya! Let's advance to the semi-finals, man. I say we go through all the events and win them all. We want gold medal on everything today. I like the build up, man. There's no difficulty settings or anything, huh? Because I feel like we need to bump it up. No! Go! There's no difficulty settings or anything, huh? Because I feel like we need to bump it up. I sprained my ankle. Who do I got? Gotta watch out for this guy in the red. Something about his hair. I don't like it. Set. See ya! Woo! Oh, that's a new record, baby! That's a world record. Doc, take the karate gi off. You don't think the gi's working? You think it's slowing me down? Bring honor to our dojo. Na na na na na. Welcome to Tokyo 2020 Olympics. That's what you want. Na na na na na. Come on! Woo! Oh, baby, baby, baby. Trust me. I know a lot of you just got here inside of the arena, trust me. This is not going to be the only one. Get your cameras out. Get some chairs out in front of this podium. I'm going to be here all day. I'm thinking we change it up. We go to baseball. Easy, right? Easy. Out of the ballpark. Home run. Home run. All right. Out of the ballpark. There's no difficulty settings or anything, huh? I want to switch it up. Let's do the hammer throw. What are we getting all excited for, man? Crank it! Woo! Pick it up, Doc. Let's go. Oh, man. Oh, baby! That's got to be a world record. Ever. Oh. Another gold medal in the back pocket. And you know what? I might even sell it on eBay. I don't have enough space. Millions internationally from Portugal, Canada. From the Czech Republic to Spain and Canada. To Mexico and Guadalajara. Am I the only one in the studio or? Hey, guys. Am I talking to myself? Where's the production team? Okay. Basketball. I'm afraid of this one. Let's jump in. Dude, this has got to be the clunkiest basketball game I've ever played. Boom! Let's go, baby! Doesn't look too bad to me. It's like the auto switching. I don't know what the turbo is. I couldn't tell you what the turbo button is. Don't tell me it's circle. No, it's not. Let's go! Woo! Easy. Nice. Hey, make sure the home guys are red. Okay. What about the visitors? Yeah, make them red, too. All right. All right. Football? They got a soccer one? Beach volleyball? There you go, Doc! Boom! Let's get a rally going. I got you. I got you. I almost want to hit that. There you go, baby! Woo! Game time. Right here. Right here. Let me end it. Oh, on the ten-foot line, baby! Woo! Let's go! That was a semifinal match onto the gold medal game. There you go! Watch this serve, champs. Here we go. Oh. I got it. Let me get it. Got it. No. Right back. They're off balance. Slam it on, baby. There you go! You want me to sign that? The picture of Tim the Tap Man. Yeah, I'm not signing that. Well, you're in the wrong arena. Get out of here. Oh! Another gold medal. Oh, Champions Club. Trust me, I'm not eating that. That was on the ground where my feet are. That's... Thank you, Mrs. Assassin. Um... Table Tennis? Do you guys remember that Table Tennis game? What was it called? Rockstars Table Tennis. That was a sick game. I feel like we're just like the volleyball thing. We're going to go right through this. He didn't like that corner, man. I don't think he has a backhand. See ya. Come on! Let's go. Right to the grand finals. With your special shot. I got it. I got it. Got you. Now it's my turn. Now it's my turn. Turn it up! Right back to that corner. Right back to the corner. Boom! Turn it up! It's a program. It's a computer program. I'm looking at the code. Easy to dissect. It's like Python language or HTML. I don't know. Pretty easy, though. Pretty basic. I got you. Come on, man. Come on. Got to get back in this one point at a time. One point at a time. You're too far off the fucking table. Your backhand is deadly, Doc! Hey, this dude, he has no answer for it. He's afraid. He's afraid to go to the right. I got it. I got it. Champs, I got it. Let's go! Dude, the guy faked me out, man. I thought he missed it. Got him. Got him. He can't get the backhand, man. I'm telling you. Remember Champions Club. I want you to head into the weekend with a lot of violence, a lot of speed, a lot of momentum. Ho, ho, ho, and don't you stop sprinting. Remind them. Let them know. Make them understand. And you'll always come out on top. I'll do it again.
