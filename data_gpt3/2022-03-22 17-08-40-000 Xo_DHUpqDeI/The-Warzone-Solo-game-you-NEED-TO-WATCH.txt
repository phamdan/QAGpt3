 This gun is ridiculous. The MG42, holy shit. You going Danny? I'm telling you man. You see what I'm saying? I mean that dude has zero chance to react. None. I don't know if I like the rotation over there. I mean it's okay. You're going to get more traffic. You're still going to have to come through the backside of that. Nice perimeter sweep you know? Did I see somebody over here? I thought I did. Yep, I did. Because once it starts trickling it starts pouring and trust me it's going to pour today. You know what I mean? Also get the wind but let's get agile. I might pick up my other loadout. The Bren. It's just I'm not getting rid of this weapon. One at a time. One at a time every time. I have to get my Bren. It's a nice weapon. That weapon was the MGS62 whatever it is. Right back there. I saw him way back there Jim. I see we get position.phone. Easy, easy, that's what we do over here man. Absolute and full control of the situation, one at a time. Be sure to like my YouTube channel and subscribe. Thanks guys, appreciate it guys. Great games, great games baby. I don't care about the story. That's three clicks, four clicks now. Five clicks, six, seven. Seven clicks to get to this. I mean these poor kids man, they're just, probably every time they're like, uh what? Oh boom what? Oh what, oh what was that? Boom what? The games I grew up with man, it was like power button on, start. And I'm in the game. I'm not gonna lie, I'm digging this game right now. You got me, you got me, you got me, because my game is fucking still glitching! Fuck man, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's, it's just, it's just, it's just. Fuck out of there! This is my fucking base dude. Bring it on! I couldn't get out, I couldn't... Get the fuck out of here! That doesn't kill me though right? I'm done with this fucking game. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's not trash. It's a fun game. It's a really good game. I love Fortnite. It's always been one of my favorites over the past couple years. And it'll continue to be my number one game of all time probably. Yeah, with all the content and stuff like that from the engine and everything. Doc, I told the gym instructor, can you teach me to do splits? He said, how flexible are you? I said, I can't make Tuesdays. Can I fire this? What's this? Oh shit. That's pretty sweet. Like a Fortnite man. They can just do anything they want, can't they? I like this thing a lot. Oh my god. Sick. Oh, nice. That's the Unreal Engine capability right there. Fuck out! Fuck! Playing for the win, baby. Playing for the win! Fuckin' we had to get it! Might have been a little slow. But you know what? We got it. Today's a big day. I'm thinking, dripping in heat. It's gonna be on full force today. I want full on attack mode. Get our trio win. Get our quad win. Get our rebirth win. You know how we do. Am I muted? Oh my god. Are you just waking up Z? Oh, I was just yelling at you. Oppression. Fire weapons last. Boom. Rooftop. Nice. Oh shit. Damn, I couldn't get away. Nice! Another one's gonna drop on me. Another one, another one. One shot, one shot. There you go baby. Easy. You got it, era. There. Got a little nade. Got a little nade. Boom, see it. Another one in there. Another one. Right behind. Same spot. There you go. Yep, another one still up top. Hold on now Z. Jesus. I'm gonna try to save you. Oh shit. Yeah, it's gone. Come on Z. Couple of warm up games and then boom. There it is. Easy. I'm checking it off. Check it off baby. Win number one. Done. Win number two and win number three on the bigger map of Caldera. Coming up. Yeah, you were on fire. I accidentally jumped out. Come on baby. Got it right here. I got it. Oh yeah. Still firing at the window. Oh God, how did he get outside? Another one down the... I'm just gonna kill this guy real quick. Can't just go back up there. Literally going to the next one. Dude, he sniped me right out of... I think he's hacking. Yep. No, I know. I'll be right there. He landed on the house right next to me. No one at peak huh? Oh man, can you get up that little hill right there? Last one. Last one's further down. I got up. Yeah, you just land on top of your roof. This is from the duo quad victory right here by the way. There it is! Come on! That's a game! That's a great game man. Forty... Forty two? Oh baby. Oh my God. I mean, might as well play Minecraft Battle Royale after this. I'm thinking that and then maybe GTA roleplay. Someone said you guys flow so well together when you game. It's like a newer, better and sexier version of Journey. Wow. I mean, imagine if you and I went to a water park and we went down the water slide. Like you went down your water slide and I'm on the water slide right next to you. And we both went down at the same time. If someone had that filmed, the synergy between both of us in each of our runs all the way to the kiddie pool. Oh man. Oh, the speed going down would be next level. It's crazy because we're both 6'8", right? So we would line up beautifully. It would be perfect. The weight distribution, everything needed to go into that. Is there a water slide that exists in the world where they keep track of the time of you going from the top to the bottom? And is it like, do they have records for that slide? I'd like to know. That's got to be something. That's got to be a thing. It's got to be right? Like, ah, got to be 100%. If it's not, there's going to be a multi-billion dollar, multi-trillion dollar water park opening up very soon with that idea. Well, first off, I'm going to get my lawyers on it first. We're going to get this sort of patented. Exactly. So if you want it in your park, it's going to be something exclusive like Doc's Diablo. Oh, awesome. The Doc's Diablo, I don't know. Well, I'll work on the name, the branding and stuff. Well, no, because then you could kind of make it around the VT. You could have it all Lamborghini. You could have it somehow tied in. Yeah, I guess. Then I got to deal with those guys' lawyers. Yeah, they're going to want to cut. You don't want to give them a cut. But like at the top, there's like a leaderboard, digital leaderboard, like forever, like the world record on that slide at that park. And then like a daily record. And then like if you've got the daily record by the end of the day, you know, maybe you get like a little, you know, a little pride. Like, I don't know. A Diablo VT? A Diablo VT. Yeah, I guess that's where Lamborghini comes in. Oh, that's where they come in. They give you as long as that's all they get. You know what I mean? You make it exclusive in the contract that you guys get nothing. You have to just provide Lamborghinis. That's it. I'm sure they get on board. I would. Sounds like a great deal. What would you call it? I mean, for you, if it was your slide. For me? Yeah. I mean, Z's. I'm going to have to work on it. All right. I don't mean to put you on the spot. Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry. The billion dollar ideas don't flow off the, not everyone. They don't flow out of everybody off the top of the dome at all times of day. All right. So give me a little bit of time to be sitting down with the with the with the team. We'll get something together. Well, what's the Z fam saying? I mean, they got to be throwing out some ideas already. Throw some ideas. Throw some ideas, please. Z slider. Z slider. Z force. I mean, we got a listen. We got. I'm going to come right here. Oh, I wanted to blow his ass up. I wonder if you got dead sauce. This dude jumped into the window sprinting on wood floors until he was two feet behind me. No audio. None. There you go, baby. Oh, my God. Oh, come on. I'm going to snipe this guy. Underneath your building. I think we got this thing down. Oh, my fucking head was stuck. Oh, my God. Oh, baby. And the sniper's on right now, huh? You know, this is just another day. Are they still at that big rock? Oh, shit. Come on, Z! Let's go! Way to play, man. Oh, God, that felt like I felt like I was in a tournament at the end there. Here we go. Challenge completo. We didn't lose one time either. No, we didn't lose. Just another day in paradise. Huge, huge. Someone just. That's yours. Is that you? That's yours? No, no, no, no. Because it's mine. I got cash off this guy. We're chilling. It's 2022 and you're still falling for it, huh, Z? I mean, we're a team. I put my full trust in you, OK?
