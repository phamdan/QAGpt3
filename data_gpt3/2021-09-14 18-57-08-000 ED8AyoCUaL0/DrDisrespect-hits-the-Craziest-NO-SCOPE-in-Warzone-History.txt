 Cody Harstad, welcome to the Champions Club. Take my hand. Live while you can. Vanessa Carlton, thank you. Holy shit. I've never heard of Vanessa Carlton. What? In the palm of your hand. You've never heard that song? I actually don't think that I have either. Can you like try to sing it seriously instead of this... Yeah, sure man....early 2000 punk... Live while you can now....and these things... I don't know the full words, but then she goes... The palm of your hand. 1000 Miles, guys, you never heard that? Oh, no. Why didn't you just say that song? That's not the fucking song. It's another one by her, but Vanessa Carlton's 1000 Miles, dude. You could have said that... Taking my way down town, walking fast, face just passing, I'm homebound. Nothing. Oh, that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one. I know that one. Vanessa Carlton. But how does that like... You like that song? I'm getting hacked on. Oh, you're not. Yeah, he is. Come on, guys. Are you fucking cheating and breaking up with him? No, I'll take this guy down. Is this today? I'll take his ass down. I don't think he's going into AIR. No, no, he's actually fucking hacking. Yeah, he actually is. I'm not... No, 100% this isn't a question. It's the first game and I'm dying in three games. You're a cheater, man. I'm not. I feel like I got him. Like this guy's... This guy's cheating. I just got killed again. No, no. There's no fucking way. He's over... No, no, no. He's over TV. Wait, where was he? But he's 100% hacking. Let's put his ass down. You want to try and fight a cheater? Who better? Don't pull me out. What are we going to do? Just get back out of every lobby? I mean, do you see how you haven't hid your screen twice and we have two hackers in three games frying me out of the air? God. How about you just adapt him? Yeah, come on, Timmy! Okay, guys. Yeah, this will go well. Yeah, yeah. No! No! Come on, Timmy! Wake up! I'm dead already! What are you doing? Chopper, chopper, chopper! Literally just shoot him in the face! Nothing. Can we get a kill count check? You can kill check all you want. If he brings that chopper up, he has seven. I was up there, Tim! No, no. You were this level. Man, nothing like playing Warzone. I'm having a blast with you guys already. Already. Perfect opportunity for me to try out my new sniper. Mark target for airstrike. A lot of snipers. Down him, down him. Two of them. Nice. Okay. I'm going up. I might come with you. Oh, there's four of them. I might not go up. I might still. Where's that satchel? I might have grabbed it. It's all good. I mean, you probably need a doc. It's fine. Yeah, that's true. That's right, bitch. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Whoa, guy right in front of me in the Tent. My God. My God on my God. Oh, my God. We're tapped in champs today. How come you no scope him but not me? Crack him crack him. I'll down him. One shot. Jesus. Look at that lobby. See ya. See ya. See ya. I don't know if you. What's up? Not there. That guy. That poor lobby. Champs. That poor lobby. I damaged him so that you can get a Claymore kill. We're gonna get a bounty and then we're gonna get this vehicle and Timmy and I are gonna shred. I have no guns for this. Enemy launched an advanced UAV. We're exposed. Go spectate some solos or something. I'm coming at you with a loadout. I'm chilling right now. I'm coming Doc. One's on the roof. Dead. Dead. Oh no. I'm safe. One guy. One last guy left. One guy. Last guy. Last guy. Take your time with it. Doc one. Doc out. Oh my god dude. Nice shot. I'm fighting a team of three in front of me Timmy and then you roll up and you push me into the team. Sit tight. Like I had whiplash man. I felt the black steel like whip between my shoulder blade. Oh Timmy. Oh man. If you had aim assist right there Timmy you're not taking any damage. Okay. You know Doc. You might be right. Timmy you've been sucking today man. Like the damage and the kills. Holy shit. You guys keep talking. Keep talking to me really quick. I'm the tan man. You have a dent in your head. Okay. It's a very shiny head and we all really like it. I got it. Thank you. I'm good. Thank you. Give me a stop. I keep going. And remember your best buys are always at Fry's guaranteed. What did you just say? No I just let it go. Oh you don't have Fry's electronics or you never had Fry's electronics in your area? Fry's and electronics? It's Fry's electronics. Tim you're a boomer. You should know about brick and mortar dude. It's where you go to buy it. It's like new egg but in person. So not French fries. No. Well that's just misleading. I thought you said fries and electronics. It is it's F-R-Y-S. Not like the food. They closed down. They went bankrupt. Well they really probably because they didn't have French fries and everyone went there for them. Okay. I need the three of us as 30 year old plus. I need the three of us as 30 year old plus. I need the three of us as 30 year old plus. I need the three of us as 30 year old plus. I need the three of us as 30 year old plus. I need the three of us as 30 year old plus. I don't want to hear anything from chat about us being carried. These are the moments when it's like the three and quote unquote the carry is gone. That's the moment when it's like the three and quote unquote the carry is gone. What did you say? I said that's the moment when it's like the three and quote unquote the carry is gone. No, I don't think so. It's not Apex. They always do. They're always curious. Did Timmy say grandpa squad? How about dripping in tea? What? What day of the week was September 10th? Anyone know? Anybody know the answer? What day of the week was September 10th? Can anybody tell me in the Champions Club right now? Lupo? Good question. No answer, huh? That's okay. Did you look that up on your phone? Yeah, that's all you got to do. Good, but it was Friday. Thank you, chat. I have my chat, so. Okay. Well, Timmy, here in this classroom where we focus on aim and precision, we don't look at your phone. So pick up the goddamn weapon. Stop taking all my kills. And let's get locked in for this next game. Listen champs, when's the last time you've taken out a sniper? Seen a helicopter flying 500 feet above your head and just said, you know what? Got a guy right next to me. Right next to me. Just stay up there. Just to cause some scene. I got the guy who was dead silenced. Collapse him. Collapse him. Oh my God. The transfer. Go back inside and armor. That guy was annoying as shit. I'm getting numb. He's like, ha ha ha. You got a dedicated doc or no? I do. Pushing it. Pushing it. I'm going to stay off this sec. Yeah, I got both of them out here. By yourself. Trying to loop right. Go. Drop the doc. Go doc! Looking good. Yeah, you are. I don't see to my left. I saw a guy. Wait, how did he get inside? Nice fucking shot. Wow. Doc, I think we play low here. I think we play under. Loop. It's like you don't want to win. Hike this guy. Got him. Okay. He's going to drop on us. Drag out. Nine enemies are still active. Hunt them down. Gases inbound. You take the cargo zone doc. I'm feeling god dammit. Those bastards have decided. Nice. Shit doc. Come on baby. Hey, bring his ass in here. Yes. He's wake his ass up. What the fuck? What the fuck? I'm sweating. I'm fucking hung over doc. I knew it. I said it. It is 322 in the afternoon. We drove almost seven hours today. I'm fucking hung over. I'm in shambles right now. Do you have any sound dampening in your room? Or is this a brand new room? No. It's brand new. I like the authenticity of this wall. I like it. Thanks. I'm booting up the game right now. What are you guys doing? I love it. Getting off the game. Alright man, see ya. Absolutely Daniel Sorensen with a hundred dollar donation. Remind him doc don't forget to stretch. Oh, I just stretched right now. I stretched my asshole.
