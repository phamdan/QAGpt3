 Ladies and gentlemen, violence, speed, and Timmy Tendies. And trust me, there's going to be a whole lot of that today in Zlaner's $50,000 Warzone tournament. Six custom games. What I really wanted to say is, why don't you go to Tim? Like, I guarantee, he's been live for three hours, and I guarantee if you go to his channel right now, he's watching a TikTok. About making a Spanish omelette waffle. Ooh. I just made that up. I don't even know if that exists. A Spanish omelette waffle. Fuck, man. I mean... That sounds good. Timmy is spectating solos again. Holy shit. That actually pisses me off. How can Timmy sit there and spectate solos when we got a $50,000... When we got a $50,000 cash grab in our hands, easily? How come you play Warzone but not me? This is RockBee with a Kanata $2.79 donation, because you're still on that dial-up connection. What are you... You're putting this energy for a team today, and I'm hearing things, okay? What are you hearing? You're talking trash, making fun of me. I was eating and watching that game, and you're talking trash, dude. Which game are you talking about? I'm talking about... I just spectated one game while I was eating my breakfast, and I waited for everyone to be ready. Okay. But... What do you mean I was talking trash? People were saying that you were talking trash because I was spectating while eating my breakfast. Also, I'm saying... No, no, no. Okay, you explain then, maybe. Yeah, it was more about sort of the situation that we're in, okay? Like ZeeLayner and I, we've been in multiple tournaments. We've been to semi-finals of Code Red tournaments. We've competed for $50,000, $100,000, $250,000 on the line playing some of the best gamers in the world that play this game, like Aiden and Raidid and Huskers and Skump and all this stuff, right? We've done our preparation work, and to know that Zee, a two-time, dripping in heat... We've got a... Today's a big... I don't know how to put this. Today's a fucking big day. It's a fucking big day! It's a big day! And you're gonna sit there and you're gonna watch some random chubby cheek, blonde bang, pink Jansport backpack-wearing idiot play the game on a Friday morning. Are you even warmed up, Timmy? I'm warm as Florida right now. That's how warm I am, alright? Zee, do you believe him? I believe him. I believe him. Doc, I don't like this mojo that you're throwing out before we're even playing, when literally yesterday... Zee, I had more kills than this guy every game yesterday. Check the bodge. I'm sorry. I was gonna ask you guys how yesterday went, you know? I didn't get to really see a lot of it. It's funny, Zee, because you could just tell that Timmy's never stepped out of the comfort zone of playing with three other people. Like, you know, I play a lot of solos. Zee, you and I, we play a lot of duos, right? Triple threat challenge, duo trio quad... Yeah, but it's interesting because there is a particular style and technique as a, you know, maybe not such a high level gamer, to be able to contribute in a quads game. I've noticed that. It doesn't make sense I play quads all the time and trios. You literally just contradicted yourself. If I was playing solos, all I'm doing is like doing recons and sitting around and running a sniper. No, it's not. Yes. No, it's not. Yes, it is. No, no, no. If you watch... Listen. If you watch previous VODs, you're looking at 18-19 kill solo win. You're looking at a 23 kill solo win. Why? You do not have a 23 kill solo win. Are you kidding me? You put money on that. You got a 23 kill solo win? Yes. Where is it? In the 1930s? No, last week. All I'm saying is we're supposed to be a team today. We're supposed to have camaraderie and I feel like you're already just kind of throwing off the vibe. All right. No, I am warm. I am ready. See, can you get in here so we can warm up? Yes. I made this thing very top heavy today, boys. 25 grand is going to first place. If we're not taking home the 25 grand... 25 grand? That's like two and a half televisions, man. That's a huge... That's a big one. That's a big one for you, Timmy. That's the guest bedroom and the garage. I'm in, man. I'm in. When was the last time you used a Tundra? It's been a while, to be honest. It was right before the Swiss. I was using the Tundra over the car 98. Was it before you bought your Jeep? Was it before or after you bought your Jeep? I started using the Tundra after I bought my Jeep. So you're not a Toyota guy? You not like Jeeps, Doc? You not like Jeeps? God. That's not an old man joke, is it? That is... Oh, brother. They might... Geez. You gotta get... Wow. He's already fired Alex. I mean, fuck, man. Holy shit. That was his line? No, he usually has the teleprompter all lined up for him. Yeah, he's... Thank you, Z. Yeah. That's why Doc is... He's gonna be a little all over the place today. No loadouts stoners. So no stoners today. Champs, let's go, baby. Game one. Yeah, I like it. I like it. Are you guys landing like right at SOS or are you landing more opposite? I'm literally landing on yellow. Right on the peg? Yeah. Can I grief someone out of this guy? Oh, man. How about this guy? Oh, it's you, Z. We got people coming. Let's take him out. This guy is low. This guy's hit a bit. Yeah, yeah. Right there. He's about to be flushed. I got no gun. Guy above? Guy above? He's one shot. One shot. Looking for one more. He's all around. It's fine. It's fine. We're okay. I'm in here. Let me see this guy's aim assist. Oh, God. This is so fucking disgusting. What? Alright, boys. And it's all up to Timmy. Alright? No. I win these. I don't lose gulags in this situation. He got this. That's the fastest fucking drop shot turnaround. Homie, I can't even blink that fast. How fast that kid just did that shit. I don't give a fuck if this guy is a pro Call of Duty player or not. The aim assist that's involved in this game is just disgusting, man. That's not the game one I wanted, but we're here, guys. Hey, Doc's getting his... I mean, sorry. Tim's getting his YouTube video out of the way. I'll just get this out of the way now. Yeah, I spectated a pro lobby. I think this is good, actually. Now that I'm thinking about this... This is all part of the plan. Wait, you started streaming during the Fortnite era? I did, yeah. Doc, we're like grandfathers in this industry. You are. You are. You used to play all the time. Way back in the day. I was playing the hottest Call of Duty at that moment. I started at Black Ops 2, Doc. What the hell are you talking about? I was gaming back then. Aggressive. But I was like... What was I? 30, 50, 40, something like that. How old are you? I'm 23. When did Black Ops 2 come out? Was I 15? Oh my God. Are you literally a decade older than Zeke? It's not a decade. How long is a decade? It's okay. It's good to have a little bit of that crystallized... What's it called? Crystallized memor... What is it called? It's good to have a little bit of that wisdom on the... Methane? Yeah, I don't know. Crystallized knowledge. That's what it is. Hoppin' on board here with Zach. This guy killed me in the gulag. I hope he gets fucking executed in game, just to be clear. Watching him ADS the wall, trying to listen to stuff. And I'm gonna pitch it on over to Doc here. Doc, what are your thoughts about this gameplay we're watching with Zach? This guy's a fucking loser. Look at him. Look at him. Oh my God, Doc. No. He's gonna be watching this overnight. Say something nice about him, Doc. I know, I know. Say something nice about him. It was just part of the situation. X-Acht, still a loser, looking behind the concrete wall, not going anywhere, but knowing that positioning is so crucial to gain those points. Z, am I correct on this? I'm passing it right to you. Well, he's currently in a top 13 position. He's looking to secure a few more placement points for those of you that don't know at home that are watching. There's a multiplier on these kills that he has. He currently has three of those. Not sure what his team had total, but those kills can be multiplied into even more the longer he gets in the game. So he's taking the strategy of sitting in a corner, sitting in some type of bush, looking up and down. I'm not sure what this strategy is. Do you know what this technique is called, Doc? Straight up, look up and down thing? I don't want to go into descriptive... I'm fairly certain this is stick drift. I'm not 100% sure, but I haven't played with it before. But Doc, I'm gonna let you guess the input here based on that spin you just saw looking at the aloe leaf under his foot. What do you think, mouse or keyboard? I'd rather pass it off to Zee at this point. He's 100% on controller. I know it from past experience. I've played against him in many tourneys. He just got wiped out from what we're seeing by Devious's team. This is a team that really likes to play positioning quite aggressively. You don't see him with a ton of kills, but you usually see him in almost every single end game. I think it's because he's a PUBG professional in the past and they really love their positioning and ratting it out all game long. Nothing wrong with that though. That's kind of what we're gonna be doing today, I guess. On board, Devious climbing up the sewer scramble. This is actually the original Gulag, Doc. Did you know that? Had no idea. Happy to be the insider. Color commentary, if you will. Doc forgot about that completely. This is the original Gulag. Do you remember this now, Doc? We are in the original Gulag right now. Oh, there it is! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, cool little Easter egg for it. 30 seconds? Great games, guys. It was fun to spectate you guys for 45 minutes. Yo, lick my butthole, Doc. Holy shit. That was the longest game I ever expected in my life. Lick my butthole, man. Damn it, Bobby! Hey, great move through the prison. Great move through the prison. That was great. I'll see you in the next one. I'll see you in the next one, man. Bro, who just yelled that about Bobby? Holy hot! They're gonna try to get aggressive here. Then bring them. Got a car behind us. One's in this house that you guys were in. Smash this guy! Down one over here. Whoa! Reality check. On the flyer. Under it. There's two in that building to our right. Two. Yep, yep. I shot Doc. One spot. Oh, man. Mine, hot, hot. You're shot. Right on him, Doc. Like in, in, in, in, in. Quack. Good job. I got one of them....or capture the objective. I had my MP5 out, bro. I went to peek the window with the Krissix, and they pushed right after I heart-beated. I was unlucky. You're heading back to... That's a wonderful, nice, and cool game back. That doesn't make sense to me. Wow. I didn't see first-aid. Doc broke his mic. Oh, no. Oh, no, Doc. Can you confirm on that, Doc, that your microphone broke its... Doc slammed his desk and broke his mic. Oh, no. Microphone check. Microphone check. Hey, you're good, Doc. What's up, man? You got flash in the gulag? Yeah. Yeah, came down to that. If you guys can shut down your stream to throw on a two-minute delay, that's the first step. Yo, deadass, bro. We got to call out where we're... I don't know what the fuck's happening, but we got to call out where we're going on the way down. Here's what we do. Here's what we do. It's probably Taz's fault, honestly. Is he your fault, Taz? Here's what we need to do. When we load into this next lobby, you guys have an intermission screen you guys can pull up, and then we can just mark on the map. We don't need to say words. We can just mark on the map. Yeah, you want to see my intermission screen, right? I'm throwing my intermission screen on right now. Yeah, me too. Boom. Hey, throw yours on, Doc, and then we're going to just mark where we're going. Yep, I've already muted everything. In fact, I'm running 25 minutes of ads right now. I like that idea. If you have not tried it, you have to. And let me know what you think. Okay, I'm writing it down. Brown sugar. 120 calories if you're being conservative and you want like a little sweep that's not too too much, you know, 120 calories. Brown sugar oat milk shaken espresso. That's the name of it. Chad, if I had to put it towards something, it kind of tastes like cinnamon toast crunch. Milk. Kind of crazy. You know what's crazy? You know what's crazy, Tim, that you just brought that up? I currently have a cereal and cartoons candle, three-wick candle lit next to me right now. Smells like cinnamon toast crunch. You know what's weird about me, bro? I don't like sweet candles. You know what I mean about that? Are you serious? Those are my favorite. I don't like the gingerbread crunch. I agree. I don't like the gingerbread crunch. I'm not about that. It's like great-great-grandma. You guys like the musky ones? Give me pine like balsam. I like that too. I'd shove that shit up my ass. Pacific Northwest coastline. I don't know, blue mist. Fresh air. Right. Each breeze in the summer, something like that. There's one called Frozen Lake. It's to die for. It's fantastic. But there is a flavor that kind of hugs the border between the two. And I can't figure it out yet. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. It's coconut. It's like this coconut. I'm all in on coconut. I love coconut. Coconut lotion, oil, all that. Coconut everything, bro. I put coconut in my head every morning. You should start a rum company. Coconut rum? A coconut rum? Wow. That's kind of crazy. I haven't drank coconut rum since I got super hammered off it and said I wouldn't drink it again. I don't even know. Alexis got like the, she got the fall candles coming now because obviously it's about that time of year. Yeah. So we got like sweater weather that way from Bath and Body. We got fall leaves, bro. Those are the candles we get. We don't typically go for like a cookie pumpkin pie. Like that one. the musky ones for sure. I prefer, I like both. I like both, but I got cinnamon spiced vanilla right next to me. I love it. I love it. I can tell you just you just start you're just getting started Z. I'm not just getting started. Okay. I'm not. You just started using candles a couple of years ago. We've got like 50 candles downstairs. Okay. I really like this one. I think it's called sweet vanilla. So for first it's my captain, my call outs. Now it's my candle preference. Yeah, you can't really win. I can't win. How do you not like cinnamon toast? No, it's the best. It was the best. It was the best, you know, I put it up there with the best like fruity pebbles though was the one that like you buy a box of fruity pebbles. There's no way you're finished like not finishing the box in one sitting one breakfast. Like two bowls, two and a half bowls. The whole box is gone. Ever just get one big bowl just like a big ass bowl that you put like popcorn in normally and just fill it up with milk and like I used to bro. But now that I'm like, you know, trying to not be fat, I literally put my cereal on a scale every morning. So that's the life I'm living over here. So your scale is like a is a bowl. It's like a aluminum bowl or something. You just put you just like put the bowl on the scale and you zero it and then you pour the cereal out. You zeroed out. Yeah. So it's like this morning I had 39 grams of Cheerios. This is our first. I love that this is our first. It's 140 calories. That's like that's half a cup. It's almost a cup. Yeah, I was gonna say, but it's not a cup. It's like half a cup. I mean, that's the serving size, Doc. But you know, counting my calories because I'm fat. All right. I can't just eat. I can't wake up and have a half of a box of Wheaties and call it a day. Oh, he's spamming subscribe to his YouTube. I guess it goes everywhere. How did this guy go down? Oh, this is big. This is big. I feel the runs of people over here. What the hell? He just won the game. No way. What the fuck was that? No way. Warzone competitive pro esports 2021 back to you. Huskers. What up? I probably watch your mouth. Number one. Number two, I guarantee you're gonna just you're gonna be so curious, right? Like you're gonna hear this little gunshot, this little SMG blast, maybe even the sniper shot, and you're gonna look over there. You're gonna be like, where did it come from? Okay, I see it on the fucking mini map. And the whole time I know exactly where you're at. And there's a reason why I shot that shot. And then right when you P Cuskers boom. I mean, that's into the game. I'm saying is when I slide around the corner to tell you, I want you to remember this exact conversation. Okay, well, you said you did you say you're gonna go close range and slide around a corner on me? Yeah, absolutely. Okay, well, this can't keep up. No, no, no. I'm plugging in my controller right now. Ah, shit. Okay, never mind. I'll meet you. I'll meet you in the field. I was a sniper. Sounds good.
