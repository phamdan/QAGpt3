This whole like streamer of the year thing for this year, I just looked at the list. I mean, we're in a whole other stratosphere, champs. I'm not even going to beat around the bush and say it! Like don't include me on that list! They're not even close! They're not! Three years, three awards. I mean, that sounds good to me. With the American flag waving in the background and the ponytail flapping in the wind, I just feel like we're on a whole other level, champs. I don't know what else to say.

We do things that are just on a whole other fucking level, champs. But I appreciate it. Ergil Aului. Well, is that a real name? Thank you for the $4.99.

Hey Doc, how much Vaseline would it take to squeeze Timmy's thighs into a Lamborghini? Well, it depends on where, like, we're gonna go into specifics. Is he in Florida? It's real humid down there, man. Probably slide him in real fast. And then he flies in there. Probably breaks a stick shift or something, but... Uh, if you're up in Canada, oh man, I don't know what we're gonna have to do. I think you'd have to turn the heater on in the car. Appreciate you, thank you for the 50th Super Chat.
