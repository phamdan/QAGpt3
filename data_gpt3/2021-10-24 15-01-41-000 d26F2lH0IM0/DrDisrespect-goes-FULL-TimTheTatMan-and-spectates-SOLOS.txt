 I think that was somebody else. I don't think that was the guy. Do you know who the hell you're talking to? No. Well let me remind you. You're talking to the two-time back-to-back 1993-1994 blockbuster video game champion and true international video gaming superstar. The name... is Doctor... Dis... Respect! Alright now that we got our intros out of the way, can we land somewhere? Yeah. You wanna hook it up? I wanna know if I'm with the real Doctor Dis. Man, Gambino, you better buckle in baby. Lambo, it's already warmed up. So, I don't know where you wanna go. How about this little red door right here? Boom, see ya. Ahhhhh! Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. These guys, these guys are... Hey, these guys ain't nothing! I downed one, I downed one all the way at the end. He's in the pool now. How about peak warrior? Peak one more time! I got two knocked in here. Gotta look good today. Right here. Let's get up here. Gambino! Alright, I like this start. Oh, straight across. In the garage. One down, down here. I don't really wanna think selfishly, but someone stole my 360 hot shot sniper kill just a second ago. I'm not too happy about it, but... I'll get over it, I'll get over it. Oh, they're in, they're in! I'm just kinda, I'm a diversion right now. Yep, they're right up on the window. I'm this way, where you going? Where you going? Where you going? Oh, I thought you were inside. Right here, right here. Gotta reload that, huh? Yeah, what about the first one? I lost him. These guys still there? Yeah, there's three of them and another team fighting them. They're coming up on the pool. Coming out my left side, I think. Yep, they're coming. Here we go. Wow, look at this. He's on top of the pool now. Oh hey, pool guys. Don't mind me. We're outta there! Alright, let's get you guys up. Oh hey, how you guys doing up here? I'll take all this, thanks. Oh, I'm gonna get this guy. I don't know. I can't do any money though, of course. Another one right behind there. Straight ahead under the pool. Oh yeah, we're gonna... boom. Now, is this friend gonna go pick him up? Oh yeah, I'll go help you up. I'll go help you up. Hold on, I'll get to you. I'll get to you. Good shit. Talk to me about the W609P club. It's just our friends. They're on top of Firehouse right over here. And they gotta come to us. Knocked one. Another one. I see him, I see him, right at the bus. Hit him once. Got him now. Nice, nice. And another one right behind him. Yeah, they're moving out, they're moving out. We have to get ahead. Right here. Come on! Behind me, behind me! Actually. Two of them. Beautiful, beautiful. Guys, in this building right here. Cracked two. Jumping off. One's on the roof up top. Gas mask animation. It's a 2v2. That it? Oh, easy, huh? Man, W609P is in the house, baby. What does VSN stand for? Violence. Speed. Momentum. Momentum. Momentum. I love it. GG's, guys. Good game. Germany. Germany. Germany. Germany. German. Germany. I think Germany can make one of the sickest house songs ever. The word Germany just transforms. Germany. Have you got that jar of Vaseline with your white painted nails and unscrewed it and taken two of those fingers deep into it and lathered yourself? Have you ever gone downhill on a bicycle with no brakes and a Speedo wrapped up in toilet paper, blindfolded, with no shoes? Neither have I. That'd be kind of cool though. There it is. There it is. There it is. Got a guy across to our left too. Look at this. I don't even know where he's at. Oh. I thought this guy. Oh, this guy. You ain't escaping. Oh. This guy right on me. Let's pull a Timmy, huh? Let's spectate some solos while we eat. This guy did not miss a shot on me. Of course, he's 98 ping. You got three fucking orange boxes all over his screen. I'm waiting for him to actually shoot at somebody. He's got a very steady shot. You can tell this guy plays a lot of solos. He knows how to play solos. Like this is like these are the servers that I get into champs in comparison to a lot of to every single warzone pro player there's just bot lobbies, right? I got professional gamers and that aren't signed yet in my lobbies mixed in with the radiest tactical play you can even imagine. Yeah, this guy's been waiting. Dexter itty 59. He's the guy. He's a he's the guy that sniped him earlier. Three kills. Dexterity. Oh, got it. Not Dexter itty. At least we get to watch a sniper. That was pretty immediate, huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nice reaction speed. See ya. Wait, how come I went to this guy? This guy's also sniping. Everyone's sniping. Oh, he's right here. That guy's slide canceling. Look at him. Nice shot. Look at my lobbies. Chips. Look at my lobbies. Ever watched Timmy spectates his solo lobbies? It's it's like he's it's like he's spectating zombies or something. Oh, he's looking. Oh, this guy's look at these guys, man. I hops out. He's cocky. He's got his sniper. Oh, you're going to get sniped. Oh, yeah, yeah. Get him. Come on, Mega Man. Get him. Don't let this guy control your life. There he is. There he is. You see him. Oh, he's going to push you. He's going to push you. You're dead. Oh. Oh. Got his ghost class. Did you get your sniper? Oh, he's not going to snipe anymore. Weak. This is the time where you'd want to snipe. I wonder if the truck saw him with a third person. This guy says, man, I'm bored out of my life. Here comes the truck. The guy's been saving his truck. Oh, that's what you get for playing that stupid ass style. To your right. To your right. A little bit up the rocks to the right. There you go. Ah. Ladies and gentlemen, we're on Mega Pin. With 15 kills in the game, slide canceling all over the rocks. Yes, this is a $400,000 tournament. And what is Mega going to do about it? Does he spot his victim? He's inside of the safe zone just a tad. Playing it incredibly smart. This guy hasn't lost a game in three years. Boom, getting shot out from his right. Now he knows where the guy's at. He almost commits to the fight, but he's smarter than that. Backs it up. Is he going to get behind the rock? Yes, he does. That's game over for his enemy. Uh-oh, Nate's coming in. Can he get it? Yes, he gets back to full health. A panic. Airstrike, panic to death. Didn't you see him laying down? No, he did not. He's right behind the rock to your right. There, you could see his legs. Still don't see him. MegaPim, pretty disappointing with using your peripheral vision. Ah, MegaPim, we need you to rotate. Jesus. MegaPim! Wait, wait, hold on. Hi, Greg. Hey, team. You need this. Hey, Greg! God, who's that good-looking guy in the background, champs? Hi, Greg. Hey, team. You need this. We need this. Greg is back! Our new dual-double-A. Jesus, Gregory. Vanguard with Mountain Dew. I'm going to quote retweet it. I am definitely not prepared for this at all, but I'm just going to kind of type up something real quick. Boom. That's how fast. Don't worry about it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. That's how fast. Don't be a chubby cheek loser like Greg. Doc, are you working on a blue light blocking Vaseline? It says bears with a $10 donation. I mean, if Valkyrie... You know she's going to knock it out of the park, too. I mean, shit. I think we do got to come up with a blue light Vaseline, man. What is... Champs, a little trivia for you. Think about it. What's reverse of Hoo-rah? Rah-hoo. You guys didn't know that, did you? Rah-hoo. Hoo-rah. Rah-hoo. Hoo-rah. Hoo-rah. Hoo-rah. Hoo-rah.
