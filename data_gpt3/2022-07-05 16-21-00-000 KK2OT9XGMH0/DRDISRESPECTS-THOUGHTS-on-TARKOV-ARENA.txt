 Doc, have you seen or commented on Tarkov Arena yet? I don't know how that's gonna play out. I need to know how it fits in the scheme of everything else. I think it has, I mean, it has potential if you think about it. I'm imagining it, you know? What's the size of the maps? Once the last guy on a team dies, does the game kind of like, what is that experience then? Does it go like, you win. Round one, one. Is it round based? What's the design of the game mode? I guess that's, I think I'm lacking that knowledge. Or is it like, just a text box that says, first place or chicken, chicken dinner. And that's it. I think if you win a game, you should be rewarded tremendously in an entertaining way, you know? Kind of like how Mortal Kombat does it, you know? You beat the guy, hey, guess what? You won, you get to finish him. I wish there was something cool like that. Maybe not direct, but something maybe hotshotish that everyone has to see at the end. You're looking at the two time. Back to back. 1993, 1994, blockbuster video game champion and true international video gaming superstar. I'll give you 11 points going to 12. Six foot eight shredded, obviously. Tarkov, fresh wipe has begun. And if you have a moment, please like my video, subscribe to my channel. We make really cool content around here. Anyways, let's go. I don't wanna impede on Lupo. I'm sure he's been ready, he's been playing this game. He's been ready. He's got his crew, right? They all hack. Speaking of, yeah, Lupo. I know it's just a joke, man. I'm just, yeah, yeah. Trying to get, yeah, I know. Trying to get Jake Sucky to- Hey, you blubber butts, what's up? Yeah, I know. Anyways, just watch yourself today. No, I mean it. You wind up in one of my lobbies, I'm putting your ass down. Yeah, all right. All right. You can tell that guy hasn't stopped playing Tarkov since early pre-alpha days, four years ago. One of the first beta tests, one of the first alpha testers, that dude right there. Is, when a fresh wipe happens, is it normal for scavs to have a long waiting time in comparison to your PMC dude? It is normal. Normal for all. So servers in general are just overloaded. Could I back out of this? I mean, fucking 12 minutes. That's a 12 minute wait right there. Today is a rough, but by the end of the day, I don't know why I went with Glade. The hell's Glade? How many words start with GA? GA gat, gat, gatling, gat, gat, gata, gat, gat, gata, gata, gawa, gawky, gawks, gawks, gack, gack, gaven, gava, gavel, gabber, gannon, ga-gaena, g-gaenor, gaener.

Yeah yeah. Alright. Bye. Who the hell are you Merk? What do you need a job? Huh? Hell! Looking for a good net salary in a full social package looking for a job? My eyes are alrighty then. I can see you by your mug and I can do anything about it. But it is ready and the lettuce ahead made tomato trying to catch up. Bubblegum sticking to the rail and toilet paper wiping up the trail. Oh my. I get so excited look at me. I'm losing focus. I don't want to kill this guy. Oh I'm so excited! I just can't hide it! Boom! Boom! Dropped that shit. Pretty unlucky that that dropped it on that side of the map. Unless. Did we go to it? Did we try to find it? So based on the path of this plane. I have an idea of the area. It could have been super far out you know. It's gonna be tough to find it. That's gonna be a tough one! How sick would it be though if we found it? You know that we'd be the only one out here. You know it. No fucking way. No way! Alright. I think that's good enough. We're going back into dangerous territory. We're out in the wide open right now. This is a bad spot. I swear if this guy one taps me I'm done. Let's go baby. Little stuffy nose. No no no no. Are we back? What do your fingers smell like Doc? Shit. Kevin Espenosa. Kevin Espenosa with a 499. Doc I'm so excited. I just bought my first ever PC from Digital Storm. Soon I will become a PC warrior. A PC warrior.
