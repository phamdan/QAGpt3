 Welcome to the first ever Varian founder event for Midnight Society. Live! Live! Who's ready to know the final name of the game? Live! We have PC Playstations to test the build. Don't show the toes, don't show the feet. Midnight Society has done so much, Doc has done so much. Let me hear what you think about Dead Rock. Let's get loud please. Live! The fact that they've got a playable build here for everyone to try out and give like the responses to the dev team about what they felt like it's nobody else is doing anything like this. It's just so refreshing to see in the gaming space that a company is taking the time to do something like this. Oh my goodness, it feels amazing. The energy here is great. Dead Drop is an amazing game to play. I'm just, I can't even describe in words how excited I am. We're Team Summertime. We're a content trio for Optic Gaming and thank you guys. Thank you. Summer, summer, summertime. Hey everybody. How's it going out there, crowd? Can I hear some noise, huh? What did you guys think of Dead Drop? Man, it's actually been amazing. I didn't know what to expect. I got one question. How is the in-game audio going to be for this game? Let's just say we've already fired six guys. So you're the star. Yeah, I personally love the name. It fits well with the gameplay that I've played so far, so I enjoy it. Leaving to the Champions Club to make a damn good looking game. Let's just focus on me for a second. I've got my sponsors. Mountain Dew Game Fuel, Turtle Beach, Rocket, a little FanDuel on the side. But I need to talk to my agency because this guy... AMG. AMG, Mercedes, Petronas, TeamViewer, Keeler Packard. Something's got to change. I actually bought this at the Timmy Tennis tailgate. Oh, you're saying the tailgate? Did you beat Timmy? Nah, he walked by and ignored me, so I came here. Classic Timmy. And that concludes the first ever Founders' Event. Thank you. But the job is just beginning. Whether you're here going home or you're already at home, get on the website, download the build, fill out the surveys, jump into the variant-only chat, because this is just day one of a very long journey. The event was awesome, Doc. I had a great time at the event. That was exciting. Dead Drop? Woo! I like that name. The name actually came into effect kind of a late decision, but the decision on the name and then the branding and all that was just like, boom. That just flowed. It just connected. And I mean, we literally, we only had a handful of people kind of initially concepting this first snapshot and the idea of the game and just, you know, for a while there. And then we really ramped up as of recent, as of late. And man. I'm, I'm, I'm just thoroughly proud of what we were able to do up to this point. Now things are really going to kind of take off. It's nice. Feels really good. And I think we have a concept that's, I mean. It'll evolve and, you know, hopefully we make something that's very compelling. You know, that's got a lot of, that's got a strong shelf life replayability. You know, that's the ultimate goal. Yes, I will. What a trip, huh? Look at that fucking structure in the background, man. I mean, look at the scale of that thing. That's where we're eventually going to be dropping in or flying in or driving to extremely valuable loot, quests spread all the way through that thing. High value items, marketplaces, pristine movement, vertical movement, grabbing rails, swinging from them, sliding down, jumping out windows, scaling sides, just to get to that next level. But at a nice pace that's just fast enough. Not too fast, you know, where it's about aiming. It's about hitting that one shot. There's a big vision set in the 1980s. What is the future like through the lens of the 1980s? Dead drop coming out in 2033. Okay. Geez. One snapshot at a time, man. Just let us do our thing, man. We're just having fun over here, man. Let us do our thing. Holy shit. All these fucking COD fan boys, man. Let's just have some fun, man. Let us talk. Let's get loose, you know? Taking a little, just to hit this a little more style, just a little stylized approach. Man, the computers they had at the event, they were dialed in. They were dialed in. Champs, ultimately what are we trying to do with this snapshot? Are we trying to show you a complete game? No, we're just... I mean it. There's no mechanics right now. There's not even lean peak. We're talking bare bones of the bare bones, and there's a reason why. Why would we go in there and fine tune all that shit, and then if we're going to be working with you guys and seeing how you want the gun to feel, how I want the gun to feel. It's just easier to tune it from a raw, bare bones starting point, you know what I mean? I mean, just look at how big that fucking structure is. You know, we want to make a game that feels super high risk, high reward. Hopefully it's got a darker atmosphere, mature. You notice there's a lot of doorways. A lot of keypads that you can't access. You know, we'll be, with additional snapshots, we'll be opening those up. You know, this is sort of what we consider your player hideout. This whole space. Right? And this space will definitely evolve. And you'll see what I mean with by snapshot too. It's a little down. There's a little fire range down here, but I'm not going to be shooting it right now. I just want to walk around. I just want to feel this place out. You know? Like what if there was just one more player in here? I heard this fucking dude looting over here in this corner, you know? Knowing that I've got a couple items myself for some quests, right? We're trying to go, I'm trying to go 40 floors above me to an extraction point. But this dude's back here. Recoil patterns, all that stuff, bare bones right now. You know? Why should we go in there and define that right now? Before getting you guys involved. We're going to get you guys involved before we do that. That's going to be the fun journey about all this, man. And I love it! Atmosphere 10 out of 10. Jack from Space, thank you for the $4.99. Doc, looking handsome. Is ever stoked for Dead Drop? It will be dropping on console for sure, right? From my understanding initially, like yeah, I mean, we, you know, ultimately you'd want to target cross play and take advantage of that whole ecosystem, right? Yeah, you know what's the fun thing about it too? Is like, it's thinking about all the cool design ideas that are just sort of being stacked right now from a conceptual standpoint, from a paper design standpoint. There, there we've, I mean, and it'll be fun to like eventually introduce those elements that make the complete design, you know? I don't know, like, let me see if I can give you example that hopefully the team will get upset at me at, right? What's an example? I think I'm okay with this just because I know that this will be something that won't be implemented till later. I don't know if I should say it. I don't want to get in trouble. I might get in trouble champs. So, so for a particular, I guess you would say element in the game, a character element or sort of event or trying to be very, let's just say we were thinking of like, if when someone dies, there's this element that comes into the level and it's like an event and what it does is after a certain amount of time, it goes in here, gets that dead body and supply and takes it out. But they're like drops through the rafters and here's this AI element and boom, and then pulls this body and shit back up there before you can claim it or be, you know, or you just hear that in the background somewhere and you know like, oh shit, a body extraction is taking place. And it's just like this event. It's kind of the scary event and it's like, I think there's some inspiration from the movie. Remember the movie Ghosts where you had like the, you know, if you die and like you're taken back into the shadows, like the shadows are like, but imagine kind of this whole event that's similar to that. Hopefully I don't get up. I feel like it's close enough to where we're going to be building that and I've already claimed it. It's our idea. I see anything out there. So just imagine like, and we have so many of these cool concepts like that that are just being stacked right now, champs. It's just so fun to like kind of every day think about this shit. I think another one is the fact like if there is a an intense ranked, let's say if there was a ranked portion of the game, I almost want that portion to be a separate sort of structure like its own unique structure, you know, in a different sort of environment or setting with kind of lesser people and the space is smaller and you have to be able to qualify to even get in there. Just like, you know, you see your rank systems nowadays, like you have to play a certain amount of times or placements or your character has to hit a certain level to be in order to have access to this area. That's kind of like what I was thinking. So it's not necessarily it's like a ranked, but it's like a high stakes ranked game. That's almost like how it's considered. Right. And then maybe the items in there have a different sort of value system. Again, that's just kind of initially I mean, we really haven't had any real discussions around it, but just in the back of my head, that's a float that idea out and see how that evolves. I don't know. I appreciate everyone coming out to the event. That was that was a that was a great time. It was cool to see all the energy of the Champions Club and the Midnight Society founders. It was cool to see everyone was just meshing with everyone. It was good energy in that place. That was highly noticeable. And.
