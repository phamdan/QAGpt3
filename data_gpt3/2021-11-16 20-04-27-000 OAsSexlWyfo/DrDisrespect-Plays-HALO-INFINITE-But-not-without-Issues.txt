 What's your sensitivity on controller? I'm just on 5.5. I think I'm just on default. Jesus. You're able to look around? Yes. I mean that's high. 7.7. That's pretty high. Like I should be able to be whipping on people. That's me. That's me. Full right, then full left. Then full right, full left. Like how am I gonna get in a fight up close? You know what I mean? Turning around? It takes forever. I don't know how you're... I'm just getting motion sickness, you know, making these slow turns. Doc, your movement speed settings are off. I just watched Noah and Courageous stream and their left to right look speed is fast. Fix it. Is it like extra slow? Max input threshold. Set far following for the maximum input registers. Okay, that's on 10 by default. I can't turn around fast enough. It's insane. Your movement speed settings are off. Are they off? Does that look off to you? That's my fastest look right there. My chat is telling me that your sense is too low. That's what they're telling me too and I'm on 7.7. Ooh, diamond one. I wish I could be fucking diamond but I gotta put in gold. Why? Because I got a controller malfunction. So champ, I got to turn it down even more. My look speed? My look speed is just something fucking... I gotta reset my game after this. This doesn't feel right. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. So like whatever you have right now. I just want to see if like something's off on my end. Yeah, I'm rocking 266. But 7.0 should be fine and then that's it. Okay, I'm gonna try it out. Appreciate it. Give it a shot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Champs, my settings are all fucked up, man. Yep, I got it. I can't... I literally can't look around. Champs, I truly think there's an issue with my movement. Even when I turned up the sensitivity, it didn't do anything. Wow. It literally didn't do anything. When I went from 6 to... what did I put on? 9? You see champs, I just turned it all the way to 10. It feels the exact same. So what did you say? Right click Halo. Go to property. Controller. Xbox controller enabled. Use default settings. Disable Steam Input. I think that's it, champs. Champs, we fucking cranked the sensitivity up. We cranked it down on the controller. I don't know if we've been here to watch. We do it many times. That doesn't do shit. Look accelerator, you're fine. I haven't been here all stream, but I just got here. I have all the fucking answers that don't fucking work, man. I'm just like... It has nothing to do with the controller. It has nothing to do with the controller. It's a brand new controller. The game's shit on mouse and keyboard. I'll just say that right now. It doesn't fucking feel good. I want to play controller, but my controller, for whatever reason, is broken. And I'm just like... I need to take a break. I've already restarted the game. I've already unplugged the controller. If I were to switch it from 6 sensed and I go up to 10, there's absolutely no effect in game. Is it the look acceleration though? What do you have your look acceleration on? I've already gone through all that. Like 2, 1, 5, it doesn't make a difference. It just remains the same. It's just slow. I just want the controller to be normal. I just really do. I really do. I can't even turn around. What's this? I don't know why I keep going to the controller thinking it's going to work, but it's not fucking working. Hey, Courage. I'm getting frustrated with my setup and I'm pretty much going to call it there too. I'd like to play all night, but I really want to play controller. Might be a bug dock? I think it is. It's got to be a bug. Hold on. Let me try something champ. Oh champs. You want to know what the issue is? I found it. Believe it or not, I thought these scuf thumbsticks, I took these ones off because I like the way they feel. The rubber, the right one is a little bit higher than the left one. Right? And I had these on my PlayStation scuf controller. I took them off and I put them on the Xbox one. And so what I think is happening here, okay, is that when I press left or right on here, because it's the PlayStation or whatever, it's not able to go all the way to the right or all the way over the left. Because of the shape. Oh, I could see it, man. It's not even touching. Champs, you can't, it's the circle. It's too thick. Hold on now. Hold on now. Let me change it up. Okay. Now let's check it out. Oh yeah, that's much better. Way better. That was the problem. Believe it or not champs, that was the fucking problem the whole time. Dude, I can't believe. So I wonder if I've been playing Warzone on controller with some issues there. Let me tell you right now. I just spent seven hours playing the game on mouse and keyboard. It's clear that this game is not built for mouse and keyboard. It just isn't. It doesn't feel good. Especially with the frames that I'm getting. It feels like it goes from 144 hertz type of feel to like 60 hertz sometimes. And also the combat just doesn't cater to mouse and keyboard players in my opinion. I mean like it's, I don't know, the sense just feels weird. It doesn't feel like your typical first person shooter game. It feels clunky or something. I can't describe it. But controller, woof. That right there, when I was just playing, that felt good man. It's definitely, it feels like it's built for console or controller players, this game. Champs, are we going to get Halo Infinite today?

Who's ever going to join us today for ranked Halo Infinite? I'm telling you, they bet like I want somebody who's locked in, who's ready to go, who's ready to kill, who's ready to go all the way to the tippity top. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, Doc, man, I got to say there's few things that just get the blood going like the Halo music. On shot. On one shot. On one shot. There's two of them and there's four in there. Yeah, yeah. Or three in there. Three in there. On the middle. On the middle is going to die here in two seconds. This dude just like appeared in front of me. Doc, I think that guy had camo. That's why he disappeared. Oh, OK. Yeah, that's a staple of Halo games, active camo. I mean, I legit didn't see anything. That's actually that's a perfect moment right there. We're locking in. Got one, got one. One below you, Doc. Weak, weak, weak. Yep, got him. Nice. Running, running, running. Another one middle, another one middle. I got him. Right side, see? Double kill. We got our snipe with two bullets left in it. Two bullets. One shot, he's super weak. Nice job. Another one below there, Doc. Right below you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right here. Pushing your back out. Better than you. Right on my axis. I don't know what's happening. That was no shields? Let's go, Doc. Good shoot. I'll help you out. I got one dead, I got one dead. Back to me. Shit, what the fuck? Oh my God, that's so stupid. Hang on, how the fuck do I lose? How does he shoot me? He's so weak. How does he fucking eat that?! Did he even shoot me champs? I don't fucking know! Smash this guy! There you go, Kurt. Got him, got him, got him! Behind you, behind you! Got him. Other one dropped down, he's dead. Yo, Ben, move to the other side of the game. Oh, free the other side! Come on! How does that not kill him?! It doesn't, I don't know! How does it not fucking kill him?! Course you win that. Course you win it. No! He's got sword up there! Oh, he's going inside right now? Nah, I'm dead. I'm dead with the knife. Here you go, Doc. Here, here, all for you. Brought it, brought it, right here. Thank you. Oh, baby! I got over field. I'm making a play here with it. Okay, there's... Okay, that doesn't pop inside at all. Come on, baby! Nobody's close! Nobody! I got a squad control. Nah, you're not. No, you're not. Get off. Get off! Speaking of captains, it'll be game over. That's a flag. Oh, I tried to turn it on the hill. That's a flag. No! I was gonna read. I am, I am! Oh! Oh, there's another one up there! Got him. I got that guy, I got that guy! You got Camo Z? I'm gonna make a play here with the flag. You should knock on a middle as well on me, guys. I'm taking back in everyone. How come you play Halo, but not me? I gotta lay off the protein. I can't believe we played Halo Infinite all day on a scuffed controller, or at least tried to on a scuffed controller setting situation with my thumbsticks. And so we had to play mouse and keyboard. Oh, man. If I could rewind time, I... I would rewind time by five and a half hours. Or at least seven hours and forty-five minutes. Man, I'm really enjoying this ranked grind though, man. I know. I've already thought you're Nazi. Dog, don't tell me how to feel. Okay. Okay.
