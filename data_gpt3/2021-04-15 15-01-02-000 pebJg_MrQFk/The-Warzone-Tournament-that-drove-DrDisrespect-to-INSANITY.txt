I'm sure he's going to call me on the flip phone real soon and probably from the timing sometimes is incredible on the, on the stream. Hey Z. Yeah. Oh, that bad. Well, just make sure you drink lots of water. Yeah. I mean, I mean, shit, if I ate that too, I'd have the same type of attack. We'll just take care of yourself. Multivitamin. Uh huh. Lots of water.

Timmy said he'd beat you in the war zone solos challenge. Timmy wouldn't, first off you wouldn't even attempt it. You could talk it, but he wouldn't attempt it. If he wants to attempt it, I'll have my team throw up some 3d graphics and I'll make sure that he looks good in them and we can make a big event out of it. It's really up to him. Right. Hey, Timmy. Hey, anybody seen my ball? Anybody? Anybody seen my ball? Two guys in front of me. Southeast. I'm going to kill both of them. Another one inside that same one. They're really good. They're really good. Joey Parsons, thank you for the 10 Doc. The poisonous Ethiopian caterpillars got me at a half chub already. Wait a minute. Did he, was he behind me? Hold on.
