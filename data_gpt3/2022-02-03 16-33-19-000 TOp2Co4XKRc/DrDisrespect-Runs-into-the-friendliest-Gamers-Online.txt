 Autonomy is an illusion. What the fuck is this song? Yeah, Alex, did you put dubstep in my cassette deck? It wasn't you, huh? Well, I'm on my way to the arena. There's a cassette that says dubstep in my fucking cassette deck. Try to say that three times fast, there's no way. I can't do that again. Alex, that's not the point. I know it was you. Hey, listen, I'm telling you right now, get the command center ready. Yeah, the two times on his way. Autonomy is an illusion. I'm going to shoot this light out that's invisible for me. Metal on the outside, our stairs. Yep, yep, yep. Looking down. Got you. He's all the way at the end. Right side, right side. I'm going to heal to try and bait him. You got the angle? I'm holding it. You got to heal too, bro. I'm going to get a shot or what? No, I'm new to the game. I think you shot me, didn't you? I walked in the door and popped you from the end of the hallway. No, you missed actually. Because I'm ADSing you. Oh, I did miss. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead and peek again. I think I might pass. Okay, so you only get one shot. Bog, I'm just here to check for Rashala. I fucking got to kill three of the homies. That's all I'm here for. I thought you were a guard. I'm going to rat it the fuck out of here. So if you want to get a shot, you can. I'm going to get a shot. I'm going to get a shot. I'm going to get a shot. I'm going to get a shot. I thought you were a guard. Just keep talking to him for me. All right, well, I'm just going to keep you in that room all day. Exterior metal stairs. You still in there? How'd it feel? So we're just going to let you kind of figure that one out. I think he's still alive. Is he on ice cream side or? Is he actually the doc? I opened the door to my bush. Oh, is it really you, bro? Is it really the doc? Yeah, I know, man. But you're going to have to die. I can't believe it. Come on. He's dead. Good shit. Oh, is that really you? He's dead. Do you recognize your voice, doc? Well, I mean. He was running the backside that way. I'm going to get a shot. I'm going to get a shot. I'm going to get a shot. I'm going to get a shot. I'm going to get a shot. He's talking. He knows. Who are you? Show yourself. Just a friend. I'm putting my knife out. Hello, friend. Oh, you shot. You shot. You shot as I stood up. You almost blew my head off. Not me. Wait, wait. Wait, let me see. Wait, let me see. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Oh, that's weird. It's still there. What seems to be the situation? What blew... What blew them away already, dude? Oh, is that right? It was a friend. It was? He also could have accounted for a dog scav kill. Shit! There were some gp nvgs in the game. Who is this guy? Me? I'm just joking. It's all coming down. I love how much you jumped about that. Oh, God. Yeah. I think this dude's waiting outside of the fucking wall still with three minutes left in this raid. Gotcha. That's a little bit better than you. That's a little bit better than you. A lot better. Way better. Know what I mean, James? Way better. Way better. Factory Shaxx. I don't know where that's at. Yeah, Factory Shaxx. It's to the right. Right over that wall. Factory Shaxx. I don't fucking know where it's at. I'm starting to get pissed off. I got two minutes left. Factory Shaxx's next skeleton. Come on. Hey, we had to play that big. Man, we played that big boy. Hey, see ya. See ya. Hey, guys. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hey, hey. Hey, what's up? Hey, I'm looking for that tool set, the second one. Not the one over there by the windows, but the other one. Wait, it's over here. Here, hold me. It's a hundred. Foreign experience. Gotcha. You okay, man? You need help? I think I'm just probably going to, you know, do this and extract. Take this, man. No, no, I can't take anything from you. It's illegal. Oh, it's illegal. Okay. They got a level button. Got a guy coming down that hallway. You're okay, right? I'm out here. See it. You're okay, right? Oh, I literally don't have a weapon and I'm bleeding. I got a heavy bleed. I don't have a weapon. Just want to let you know. I see the shadow. Look at me. I'm standing in the middle of the hallway. I don't have a weapon. Look at you, man. You're geared up from head to tippy toe. I'm bleeding heavy. I got no meds. Nothing. What's this? That might not work. Take that hemostat right there too. I appreciate it. I'm just, I was just going to quickly extract, but I appreciate it. I'm going to loot this other guy. Yeah, you do you. Appreciate it. Take care, huh? Coming up the ramp. How you doing? No, no, no. That's just, that's. Watch out, scav. Hiya! So we had a nice guy follow us around and then unfortunately had to pay the price, huh? How you doing? Hi, hi, hi. You're the scav, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't you dare. Don't you dare. There's a couple other guys in here. Oh shoot, it's a whole scav party. Look at these guys. Look at these guys. Hello, hello, hello. Did you already check these jackets? You have this room. Go ahead. I'm a nice guy. No, no, no. Jackets. Yo, what's up, scavs? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at this guy though. He's kind of. I'm checking out how to talk. Yeah, no, someone killed all the guards. Oh shit. Fuck! How does it not kill him? I didn't trust him, man. Did you trust him? Hey, I couldn't trust him. Hello? Anyone in there? Yeah, yeah. I just got a pistol. That's it. Oh, nice, nice. All right, man. Well, I just killed someone at the bottom of this hill. Nice. You can have his loot. I'm really here just tasking himself. Yeah, I'm looking for that ZB, what is it? 014 bunker? I have no idea where that thing's at. Oh man, that's like way north from here, man. North from here? Yeah, yeah, the ZB 014, right? You mean south. You mean south from here? I'm right above you, by the way. Right on this rock. Oh, shit. Thought I heard you jump. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think you might be right, actually. Yep, yep. Confess. South, okay. Yeah, yeah, you're right, man. My bad. Hello, what's up, man? Up. I'm not really trying to loot or anything. I'll get bodies over here if you want to. Oh, you're not? All right, no worries, man. All right, right above here? Right up top? Oh, back here, back here. I just saved you. By the way, I just saved you. Yeah, man, this guy's ADSing you. This dude was just ADSing you. Thank you. Hey, gracias on that one. Yeah, yeah. Here, loot him up. I got you six. All right, man, take care, huh? Yeah, yeah, you too, man. All right, let's go find this fucking bunker, champs. ZB012, I believe it's... Oh, we fell... We couldn't jump off Escape from Tarkov yesterday. But, Doctor! God, Doc, I don't even know what the fuck this game's about. It's boring. I just watch you drink water and heal yourself with water for seven hours, bro. Seven hours? Ah, I haven't stood up in seven hours. I feel like the blood's kind of going to my head. Oh, God. Fuck is this sound?
