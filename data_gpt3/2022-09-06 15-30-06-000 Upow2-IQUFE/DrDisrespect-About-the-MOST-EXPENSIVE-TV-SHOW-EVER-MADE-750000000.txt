 Gee money money. Thank you for the five house of dragon thoughts. I didn't get to it I got to the Lord of the Rings new show power of the Rings ring power I don't know what the name of it, but I got like halfway through the first episode I think it's done really well the production on it's really nice I think I was just a little bit too tired to stay up through the Hello, and then it kind of it goes like it started off dark and scary which I kind of liked right then it got to This oh, it's a wonderful world And it was like real, you know, you got the teeny teeny teeny you know, it's really really soft and vibrant and colorful and and It just went from one degree to this and I just that's when I turned it off I'm sure if I have the patience to sit through it I'll get used to it and then the episodes and then all of a sudden you're attached to these the good people I think I was just too tired at the moment. It was late when we started watching it I liked how it started though the production looks sick. What's am I hearing the budget for that show is 750 million dollars. Is that a real thing? Rings of power 1 billion 450 million each episode. I heard the budget was 750 million house of dragon is better than rings of power says G money money with a $20 donation who shit if the if the house of dragons is kind of is I hope that That has a dark tone to it. Like when I say dark, I don't mean it to be like negative and dark I'm just more of like a serious tone Rather than like the music takes over and it becomes whimsical, right? And I don't know that kind of hugs the border of mainstream stuff I just want everything to have the same type of tone as dune. I guess that's what I'm saying Because dune is the mature serious darker tone of a movie and it feels very mature because of it. Oh Roddy, thank you for the 999. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
