Alex, what's this song man? You're gonna stand up. Now what you're gonna do is you're gonna stand up. I'm gonna stand up with you though. I'm gonna stand up with you. I'm gonna stand up right there with you. Get the f*** out of here man. Get out! Someone take a screenshot. Oh my god. Oh man, I'm excited to play Odin Ring. You don't understand. I've been purposely not watching any Odin Ring content. Nothing. I've been avoiding gameplay, trailers, or montages or streams of this game because I want it to be as fresh as possible. Okay, before we jump in, let's just talk about our guy. We've been focusing a lot on strength and vigor. Or is it vigor? Or is it vigor? I don't know. You know what's really been bothering me? There's one thing that I just want to take care of. So follow me. This guy. I'm gonna go find her. Rescue her. Bring her back. And then get my reward. Dude, my dude's possessed. Look at him. Doc, you think Timmy would play this game if said Odin Onion Ring? There's a lot of land to discover man. That gets me excited. Let's go inside. Let's take a little visit down the cave, huh? What the f***? Are you kidding me? I gotta get out of here. These guys are gonna trap me in, huh? Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. What the hell is this cave? I'm gonna fight this guy poison. I don't care. See it? You know what I mean? Easy. Easy. I don't know what the big deal is. I mean we just suffocated him. Guns Gutaku. Thank you for the three. What did one snowman say to the other snowman? Smells like carrots. Okay, there we go. There's your new armor. There it is. Look at this guy now. Now we're starting to get a little carrot. Now he's starting to define his path. You know? Yaya. Huh? No! Yaya. You're gonna disrespect me when I walk away, huh? You're gonna disrespect me. You're gonna walk away? Is that what you're gonna do? Well, guess what? Shh shh shh shh shh. I know. I know. I know. I know. Who is it? Boom. He's back. I get it. That's not good enough. That's not gonna be good enough. How about a little blood swipe? Oh, you're almost dead. Your little guys. I'm not even focusing on them. I don't even want to focus them on them, big man. Look at this. Now you're all dead. I feel like there's nothing here. Is that a hole down there? That looks like a cave right there, doesn't it? All the way down there? See it? Way down there? Here we go. Nice picture. I knew it was gonna, like, I didn't want to look. I didn't want to turn too soon. Going into this thing, it probably looks pretty sick looking out of the cave. That's a nice shot. Look at that thing. Very impressive game. From a world design standpoint. Very impressive. Would you look after this medallion? You must keep it out of the Cursemonger's hands. And if you should meet the young Albinore Clotena, then please give it to her. Will do. Let's get involved, shall we? It's super high level. I got a feeling finally in the game today we're gonna get challenged. At least a little bit. That's a long ways down, huh? An athletic game, man. It's just so bad. It's so fucking pathetic, man. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm gonna do balance shit right now. I don't want to jump too soon. Is it because I'm too wielding the sword? It's kind of a slow leveling day so far. We're not getting a lot of, uh, what do they call them? Rupies? Now we go down, go up to the hill to the right, hit the vase, a guy will pop out and give you a medallion. Then go back to the round table and defeat the invaders. Round table. You guys want me to go to round table? I keep hearing round table, round table, round table. Bambino, they give it the 20 months. Kaylin, 20 months. Innova, welcome. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Jesus. What a little blood splat. Huh? And then a... I'm just gonna out, I'm gonna bull you. My guy is too strong. He's just too strong right now. Let me stand on the cliff right here. Let's take a look at the valley. What do you think? It just feels like nothing's gonna stop us tonight. The valley below, we've been through it. But we're going right to the top. Oh, the tippy, tippy, tippy top. We don't know where it leads, but we're gonna find out. Just seeing it's taking me to this path. Oh, hold on. Before I jump off. Ooh, I like this door opening, opening, being open, baby. Howdy! This is a hidden boss, champ. Whoa! What? I hit, I hit the flash button three times and it fucking throw it up! Yeah, let's just fucking pound him to death. Who cares, right? Let him do that. Keep him busy if you can. Of course, it unlocked again. Out of nowhere. It just, it didn't lock on him. Now I'm gonna need you to get in here now. I'm gonna need you to get in here. There you go. I don't care if I didn't pick him up. I don't care. There's only a thousand of them. Easy. See ya. See ya. What the fuck is this? Get the fuck out of there! I know where you're at. I know where you're at. Easy. Easy. Easy. A little bit darker. This is what we do. Okay, maybe that's what we don't do. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Right in there. Uh huh. One more time. There you go. Alright. Alright, we're good. Boom. Could have gone right there. I was thinking you were going to have the yellow ones. I'm just going to do a little... Should have gone to the right side. No! No! No! Finally. Alright. You just have to stay in his pocket. That's all that is. Boom. Get out of here, baby. Get out of here. You got the guts to compete with two times. I'm looking for three ghosts. I don't see three turtles. Oh, there's one. Ah. That's two. Last one. We need to find this last one. Where is this third turtle, man? Ah. The seal on the rise has opened. At least it didn't take too long. Is all this worth it? Let's go right to the tippity-top. Memory stone. Feels like... Definitely was not worth it. If only I had a giant, but hold. Finally, if I only had a giant, but hold. Try hold. Do it. Seek. Player cake, thank you for the 3.14. Loving the Elden Ring playthrough. Hope we see you make it to the end. Have a good night. I feel like I need to get to the end of this game. I'm going to have to go back to the I'm getting a little sidetracked trying to find this and that. Like, maybe I just stick to the main quest. I'm on the main one right now, aren't I? Or am I in some fucking cave that I shouldn't be in? We'll talk about it next time. Sketchy, thank you for the 9.99. Doc, I saw Alex on the way to my seat. He said you guys are going to be in the cave. I'm going to have to go back to the cave. I'm going to have to go back to the cave. I'm going to have to go back to the cave. I'm going to have to go back to the cave. I'm going to have to go back to the cave. I'm going to have to go back to the cave. Hey Doc, I saw Alex on the way to my seat. He said you guys are working on a Dotcast montage and super Dot Chat where you speed read every single super chat that comes in within 10 minutes. Is this true? Yes? I don't know if you've got access to my flip phone or my emails, but you're onto something. One more! There it is! Let's get on this side though. I've got a little something to say to you. You never stood a chance. You never stood a chance.
