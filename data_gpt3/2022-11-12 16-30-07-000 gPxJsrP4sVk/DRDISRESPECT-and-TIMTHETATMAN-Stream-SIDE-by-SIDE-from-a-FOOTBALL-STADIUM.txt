 BOOM! This is my first time seeing it. Sounds like Doc's walking out. So let's take a look. How many footballs do we got? Oh, we got a lot. Boom! Doctor? Pretty good, huh? It's great to see you, man. Where's my camera guy? Just to be clear, I want everyone to know. I'm very... Hey guys. All right. Obviously, we have a very special stream going on today. We're going to dominate some MW2. I mean, that's a given. It feels good to be back here. I remember the last time I was in the stadium. Well, come on, man. We're here at the Niners versus Cowboys game inside of the Dallas stadium. The game is over. Because we won. Good luck next year. Anyways, we can move on. This is your show. Thank you. And then later on, and I think you guys are going to get a kick out of this. I'm going to challenge the two time to go down onto the field. Oh, now we're talking. We literally have fire and fireworks, I think, at Archman. How custom can we get here? Production. Can I do individual? I think they can just do all. In my arena, we can do individuals. I'm just saying. Well, this is my arena. Well, you're borrowing it. Wirtle? I'm not playing Wirtle right now, guys. Chats, please. I've never had a monitor so low. Put your chair down. Is this your chair? I mean, Jesus. All right. See, no wonder he was taller than me. He's cranked all the way up. That better? Yeah. Push up, up. Don't push it in. Up. Pull up on the little. Nice. There you go. This is a nice chair, huh? Yeah, pretty good, right? Someone in my chat goes, are they really at the stadium? I don't know if you can see. Can you guys see that guy down there? You think that guy's green screened as well? He's trying to figure out how to send it individually. I do have to say, don't hurt Kevin. OK. I won't. I can throw him. I'm not allowed to. 70 yards in the air. Oh, Chad, look what I brought, bro. Oh, Timmy. The two time and the two ton. How do you not utilize these fireworks every five minutes? I don't know how much is in the tank. And I don't want you. There's certain things we're going to, you know, I was thinking maybe like, boom, boom, boom. So I don't have the green light. You have the green light. Yeah, technically it is. It's my row show, but like, oh, holy shit. OK, dude, you're going to scare me. Stop just yelling. We're going to throw you out of here. How do we get these things active? Production, can we turn them on right now? You got to ask. You got to go through this process of asking somebody. I got you. I see how you're running the show. All right, get ready. You can do your thing. I'm just going to go boom and boom. Boom. That's what I'm talking about. Pretty good. Pretty good. Yeah. On command. Yeah. It was more set up. It was super fluid. It was super fluid. Yeah. If you just edit the beginning part out where we're asking. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, listen, there's nothing more Doc likes to do than play Modern Warfare 2. Are you reading donations and stuff today too? It's kind of weird. Like I can hear you reading your donation. Like I don't even know how to mute you. Nothing. I do have a $5,000 dollar doughnut here, but I'm not going to read it. That's $5,000. Wow. We got a $6,000 donation. Oh. Doc, if this is really good, should we just like do this side by side forever? Yeah. I say we get a warehouse. Yeah. All of you have. I'm all in. I'm all in. All right. Cool. I don't know what kind of shoes Doc even has on right now. To be honest with you. Do you even know what these are? I've never in my life seen those. But if you were to guess the brand, what would you think? Those are Jordans? Come on, baby. What are those? I've never seen those. These are limited edition based off the Eleven's breads. Let me give you a little history lesson. Okay. They're based off the Jordan Eleven's breads. I showed Doc my calves as soon as he got here and they said they look good, guys. Just so you know. He might deny it later. No. That's not what happened. You immediately showed me your calves and you say these look good, don't they? That's not what happened. Yes. That's weird how we... All right. How did you get the Elgato? You got the whole setup. Like, do you have all your scenes and stuff? I mean, we can go to the stadium. Just like that. Ah! Boom! Tim the Tap Man and Doctor live. Dude, you got a... That's pretty cool. And you got little fireworks. Yeah, I got fireworks. See, I got unlimited access. Unlimited access. Right. I'm just going to cue right in. Yeah, get us in, baby. I'm going to be honest. This first game is probably going to be one of the best ones we got. So enjoy it. Okay. Ready to go. This is a great map. This is perfect, dude. Let's win this. All right, Doc. I feel like I'm already locked in. All right. Doc, you and I are the only group of people who kill us on our team. So that's kind of alarming. And most likely I got more kills. All right. Doc, can you play a point with me, dude, please? No, I'm going for kills. All right. On top of the roof. Oh, absolutely shredded. Okay, I need you to do something. I mean, I'm... Jesus! We both have three kills. Oh, yeah. These gamers are coming AT&T. They're really good. Meanwhile, Doc, are you... I'm here. I'm here. Are you on 60 FOV right now? Dude, put your FOV up. Oh my gosh, man. What are you... Oh, you're right, man. I'm at 80 FOV. Jesus. Can you give me some help here? I feel like... I've looked over and you've been in the settings. This is in type. It's okay. All right. I highly recommend that hashtag. Yeah. Would love to see you do free-for-all right now on the Jumbotron. And then I would match that. In fact, I'd win. Boom! Please don't hear me. Free kill. Wait, dude, that's... Yo, this is super hard. No, wait. Don't get on his side. It's true. Tim is in panic mode. I got one! Let's go! I'm just gonna have you... What's up, man? Hey, you distracted me. That was his fault. No, he's calling me. Oh, no, he's calling me. No, he's looking at me. No, he's looking right at me. He's looking right at me. He's trying to take a picture of me. Yeah, no, I'll be down there. What's that? Yeah, Timmy's playing. I know. Yeah. This guy's a professional gamer. Yeah, I know, Billy. Hey, shut up, Billy. How about that? This is like being at my friend's house and he won't let me play. Well, this is almost done, Doc, and I think I'm gonna have four. This is the longest free-for-all game I've ever seen in my life. Oh, wait till we watch yours. I'm sure there's no input delay whatsoever. How much if I win a free-for-all on the Jumbotron? Easy 10k if you can do that. Although you still owe me money, so... If we're really gonna get down to this. I'll take the bet. I think I gotta switch to your chair in order to do this. Wow. What's going on, Doc? Not as easy as it looks, huh? Boom, boom, boom! In the song. Oh, we got one! Boom! Boom! Yeah, it's this Xbox controller I just... Yeah, it's definitely not the input delay we're playing on. Boom, just got shot. What are you doing? You know, I've had enough. I've had enough. The controller thing. It's not the controller... You see what I'm saying? It's a controller issue. Dude, no, it's not. It's a controller and audio issue. $250, a two-ton in the two times side by side. $350. Thank you, Evans. Guys, if you do donos, I'm sorry. There's like no way. Yeah, champs, I'm in the same boat. It's hard. I want to clarify, I appreciate everyone. I want to clarify that I appreciate it. Wow, $1,500 donation. $7,000, right? Whoa, whoa, whoa, $9,000 donation. $10,000, unbelievable. Doc is terrible at video games. But we have something that Doc and I have been doing a little back and forth here. We've been doing some thumbnail wars and at AT&T Stadium here, we decided to take the thumbnail war to another level. So here's what we're going to do. There are going to be two separate polls going on and based on the votes, someone is going to win the thumbnail war today. Haven't seen each other thumbnails. We've only seen our own. Whoever loses has to use this as the Stream VOD thumbnail for today's stream. Well, this is, so this is Doc's thumbnail. This is my first time seeing it and... What's going on in this picture, huh? What, did I say violent speed waffles behind me there? Is that, chat, why are you guys all laughing? You got the Bronco parked in bro repair. Wow, attention to detail on this is really good. Bro repair. You act like I eat a lot bro. Wow, that's, I mean, you got the dent, you got the lazy eye. That's good. So that's Doc's thumbnail for the thumbnail war. My thumbnail for Doc today. How do you know I had a robe like that? I just, you know, got a little insider information on a fortunate, had a little accident with his incredible Lamborghini. This is not real because that's not a Diablo VT. You're right. That's not a Diablo. I actually think that's an SVJ. That's not SVJ either. It's an SVJ. No, no, no, no, that's the, that's the smaller one. The Hurri-con. That's not a Hurri-con. That's a Hurri-con. That's not a Hurri-con. Chat, am I right? Yes, yes, Doc, you're incredible. Doc, you're so good looking. And, okay, no, I was asking the question about the Lambo, guys. I'm losing, I'm losing in my chat. Are you, are you beating me over there? You know what? I'm going to vote for you because I kind of feel, this is your show. Okay. Oh. All right. Well, I have a gut feeling. Chat, you guys kidding me, bro? This is my thing. You guys are going to torch me that hard? How am I losing in my own chat? The result of the poll is Doc 60% and Tim at 40. Oh. It's 85% to 14 over there. And my chat, I got a real bone to pick with y'all. Are you guys serious, man? Little stares. Yep, yep. I'm snappy. And I look good. I'm snappy and I look good. Now we're starting to cook. Let's go, baby. Whoa. See it? Got him. See this guy. Oh no. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Disrespective Timmy Tatman. Bye, Timmy. Okay, you're not leaving. Oh, like, what am I doing? Like you're not leaving forever. Like you're saying bye to me, but I'm still going to talk to you. You get it? Yeah. He's going to go down to the field and after the last stop in January, it's going to be signed by me and kidded out. It sounds like Doc's walking out. So let's take a, let's just take a look. It just feels so familiar to me. Like I've been doing this my whole life, you know? Can you hear me, Doc? I can hear you. I can hear you. Yeah, I can hear you. And I'm looking at your... Well, we lined up. We're on the 40. Well, you're on the 40 right now. Let me, let me try and look here as well. Hang on. Should we start off with the penguin in the back? Woo. Okay, Timmy. You're running the show. You let me know what you want me to do. Well, I mean, can you just immediately come down from playing with me and throw a 20 yard accurate pass? Accuracy? Well, I mean, what do you think? Where are the scouts at? I'm looking at the scouts. Anybody show up or... Hey, Timmy. Timmy, just watch, right? Yeah, show me something. Okay, hold on. I got you in my ear. Like it's, it's a distraction, you know? Boom. That's it. You know, that one hit. That's it. That's it. I will give you, I'll give you that. You hit a 20. All right. Fairly accurate. Are you laughing up there, Timmy? No, you're closer than I thought to me. I feel like you're laughing up there. I'm not. I'm not. How many footballs do we got? Oh, we got a lot. Boom. Oh! Boom. Knock it down, too. Okay. Okay. See, I told you, hey, just give me an opportunity to get warmed up. That was, that was a good... I almost want to back up a little bit, you know? That was a good 30. Okay. So now, I mean, if you're trying, are you going to Kevin now? The penguin? That's a 50 yard pass. And fairly accurate if you could actually hit that. I mean, 50. Okay. Okay. I mean, for his first 50 yard pass, that's a lot closer than I thought. Okay. Give it one more shot for the fifth. Oh, do you want to do the 50? You want to go back up to the 40 where you were for a 40 yard pass? No, we're doing 50. All right. One more shot at the 50 and then, and then I think you're out of here. That might be... Woo! That was right on the line. That might have been... Timmy, I can't stop, Timmy. That might have... I can't... Airs it out. All right. All right. All right, Timmy. Hey, Timmy. Yeah. I don't know where you're at. I'm right here. You see me? No, I don't. I'm waving at you. No, I don't see you, Timmy. How don't you see me? I'm right... You know what, Timmy? What? Appreciate you guys. Until next time, Timmy. You out of here? I'm out of here. All right. I thought you were clean with fireworks or something like that, but I guess not. To be honest. You just yelled, boom. No, they're not. Oh, hey, talk. Yeah. Yeah, get ready. Okay. All right. Boom. We'll see you next time, Timmy.
