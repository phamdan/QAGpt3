 You should lowkey do it. I'm doing it right now. Hey! Cheater. Guys! Welcome to my YouTube channel. Today, just for a limited edition run, we're going to be spectating Timmy spectate solos as he talks right over my intro. Please like the video, subscribe to my channel. God, we're having such a good time on YouTube. Hey, that's your official intro. Let's see if we can cut that up. Timmy, shut the f*** up. How about I spectate long side with you? Doc's watching me? Yeah, I'm watching you watch solos. What's up? Hey, Doc, I'm f***ing doing a spectate, bro. I gotta spectate one or two and then I'm ready. I had to play Geoguessr. I got out at 12 o'clock. It's not my fault that Doc gets on so early. That ain't my... That's not my problem. Well, you usually... Hold on. Can I talk? I'm in my f***ing routine. Can I talk for a second? Yeah, thank you. Usually... I had to torque my little ass for, you know, a top D. I'll go for it....a hundred dollars and s***. And then we got into the game, dude. I'm in the Lambo right now. I'm not late. I don't have a f***ing schedule. It's impossible for me to get out late. Literally, actually impossible. It is. It is. You can't tell me that I'm late. This guy doesn't let me talk, does he? I could not stream the rest of this week and it's totally okay. This guy won't let me f***ing talk. I do not have a schedule. This isn't me clocking into work like I used to do at the warehouse. I had to be there and f***. You get on 15 minutes purposely before me every single time so you can have that little jump start in your viewership. And we both know this. This is how the business goes. I'm throwing the s***. I love yogurt, but if I'm honest, I'm a fan of peach. I like peach yogurt. Oh, God. If I'm honest with you, bro, it's kind of sad that the peach emoji has turned into an ass because I love peach yogurt. Yeah, and it's ass. My wife, hey, yo, honey, get me... Pistachio....yogurt and I want to use the emoji. I'm telling you. I'm talking about her ass. Hey, Loki, bro. Loki, bro. Pistachio yogurt. Never have to say the s*** emoji because I eat eggplant. But it's like the peach emoji has turned into an ass, dude. F***. You saw him to your left. Oh, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That Thermite was actually crazy. Round of applause for Curtis in the chat, ladies and gentlemen. Come on, champs. I just want to circle back to this for one second. Rainbow sprinkles. Fruit at the bottom yogurt is above and beyond better than no fruit at the bottom yogurt. Facts. Wrong. Well, you can mix it up and you got the fruit at the bottom and stuff like that. Unless you made the fruit. It's so much better in every way, shape, and form. Nah, listen to me, Timmy. Unless you cut the fruit yourself. Non fruit at the bottom yogurt. I'm not buying that fruit that's at a yogurt shop, okay? At a yogurt store. I'm not...like it's been sitting in that bin and it's dried up. I'm not...no, no, no. Yo, Curtis, do something sick, dude. Yeah, do something, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, boom. Holy s***. What is this gun? Timmy. Is that a shotgun? It is! Timmy, we need this build. We need... What the hell is this? We need... Whips, what the hell is this? Whips! What the f*** is this build? Send it over. Screenshot it. Whips! What the hell is this shotty? No, pull the shotgun back out. What the hell was that? Screenshot it. Dude, it's like a shotgun sniper kind of thing, bro. I think he's got slugs in him, but which shotty is that? If you played Escape from Tarkov, I'd tell you all about the ammo types, but I just feel like it would go right over your head, man. This is my f***ing show, okay? I'm running the show here. Well, I'm watching you run your show. Wow. This is awkward, huh? It's hard, bro. It's really hard. I need to learn more about this shotgun. Yes. Yes, boom. I want to... Oh, no! No! I don't want to watch it. I don't want to watch Rocket either. Rock, can you pick up that shotgun? That's good. Alright. That's great. Hey, Tim, you always tell us to tell someone you love them, but I don't think I've ever heard you tell Doc you love him. By the way, love you, bro. Thanks, man. You know, do I love Doc? I mean, that's the question. Like, if Doc was in a bar fight, I would have Doc's back, right? I would. But like, if Doc and I were the last two people on Earth, the only way we could save humanity was for us to share like a 10-minute hug. I don't think I could do that, bro. But... Tim, you got an OnlyFans? Probably soon, Michael. What happened to... Shit! What happened to your demon play? The guy's terrible. Hey, Doc, this is one of your viewers right here, right? That's what I'm talking about, baby! Violence! Oh, I'll go with you. Violence! Speed! Momentum! You know what, Doc? It's very appropriate you're watching this, bro. Why? Because this is one of your viewers. VSM. Yeah. Fucking crapped out of his mind. Look at him. Boom. He's got nine kills. The safest club's really made of. Yes, yes. Good timing. Come on, baby. Let's go, baby. Come on, come here. Hey! Go ahead. VSM. Let's go. Top the world. Fucking put on a show, baby. Violence. Speed. Momentum. Momentum. Momentum. Violence, Chris. Speed! Momentum. Momentum. שב liraверה Oh, he's gonna win. He's gonna win, baby. Let's go with that. Let's see what the fuck you got there. What's going on in this game? All right, iyi speech, baby. Okay, you guys, stop God- CNưa? Come on, gurl. He's gonna win baby! YES! We're in a 1v1 situation, holy shit! Ooooooooh, ladies and gentlemen, we're on board, Jerks of violence, speed, momentum, champions, club member, and boy oh boy, he says he's going to put on a show live in front of millions and millions around the world! And here we go! Timmy says wow, he's champions club member, he's not going to get the job done, sorry doc! Hahahaha! Timmy picking at his hands, nervous, anxiety setting in. This is the game, ladies and gentlemen, oh misses a couple key shots, but that's okay, gets the clip loaded up, Zone is pushing him in, a couple shots there, this could be it as this guy has to trickle out of there, he has one shot, that is the end of the game! Violence, speed, momentum, momentum! Sending it back to you doc. I doubt it. Can we also admit doc's just better than you at Warzone and better looking? I will never admit those qualities. Yes, yes, way better, way better. Let's see what he has to say baby, come on. Hey Timmy, doc, just stop talking shit to the boy doc. Love you Timmy. Your boy's really killing shit. Love you Timmy. Love you Timmy. Woo! Let's go Tim. Timmy Tenders. Timmy Tenders baby. Where's the guy that, who's got the fucking speakers on? Hey turn it up! Hey Cole, can you mute your mic? What are you doing? Ah, just celebrating with the Champions Club right now, give me one second. Okay. That was a pretty good win for him man, I can't lie. I mean that's what the Champions Club does, you know? Violence, speed, momentum, that's what's brought. Do you want to spectate a duo together doc, bots? Woo, I'm in. Hey guys, Dr Disrespect here alongside Tim the Tap Man. Looks like we're jumping into a game to spet-take some duos. This is going to be a hell of a YouTube video, please like and subscribe to the channel. Wow, great intro doc. You like that? I've been practicing. I'm just going straight down and out of the map. And I go right to Gulag, I'll lose Gulag. That guy has a terrible shot, I don't want to spectate him. I don't even want to spectate this guy. He killed me pretty quick, bro. Hey guys, Dr Disrespect here, two time back to back 1993, you know the rest of the details. Listen, we're watching fucking crew. Can someone work on my teleprompter here? What's wrong with it? Doc, what are your initial thoughts about crew and Leo Pop as a duo team running together in Caldera? Crew's got six kills right out of the bat, Dimi, I like this guy. I'll put $1,000 down, this guy wins. What? You owe me $1,000. They're still in it. Wait, do they have Gulag? They do. Oh no, wait, okay. Okay, Leo is, I got to watch crew. Oh God. It's all down. And it's all come down to Leo in the Gulag. Oh no, what do I do? I can't do it without crew. I don't want to reload my weapon. Oh my God. Hey, let's go. What's this green smoke right here? This is a supply crate. Where is it? You owe me $1,000, bro. I doubt, now we're probably not on the same team, huh? Who are you on right now? Mayhem. Mayhem and John Wick? Yes. Nice, we're together. Mayhem might win this. Oh, here we go, bro. You owe me $1,000, dude. I'm double or nothing. I can't hear you. Fuck, man. What are these deaths? Triple or nothing? I feel like I'm watching a doctor disrespect montage or something. No, guys, they still technically have Gulag and mayhem is still technically alive, dude. I'm telling you, mayhem. Don't count them out. All right, loadout part two with mayhem and John Wick. Wall hacking. He's ass. Look at him. He knows exactly where they're at. Look at him, boom, looking right through that rock. Look at this, boom. Look at that. Got this guy waiting for him. Using wall hacks again to mark the second guy. Look at him, already locked on him. Where's John? You know, since the UAV has been taken out, I feel like there's a ton of clusters and bullshit. Mayhem literally just ran into it. Dude, these guys are fucking ass, doc. Mayhem, they're winning this whole thing. No, they're not. Look at this, easy res. Remember, this is double or nothing. So if these guys die, you owe me $2,000, right? No, if they win, you owe me $2,000. Right. But if they lose, you owe me $2,000. Wow, that seems unfair. Guys inside the house, landing to his right. Whoa, set the fuck down. Bro, that well gun is actually crazy. Is that him? I don't know, take a shot. There you go, the other one's just sitting there. Oh, he's getting aggressive, I like this. Is he communicating to his teammate? Yeah. No, he's not. That man was literally just looking off the top of the... Interesting. A little rotation, boom, boom. There you go. Oh my God, definitely not wallin'. Come on, John. He doesn't have a stealth, it's all on John here now. Come on, John. If I'm honest with you, this is more Mayhem's fault that he left John. I think John should have kept up with him. The same thing is like us. John sounds like our game. Yeah, you should have fucking... You should always be right there with me. You should communicate to me that you're doing that. That's what you should do. I'm already starting to get upset and we haven't even played a game. Now I'm getting gunned, but I won it. Good job, John! No, but then you go down, here we go. Let's just go ahead and finish this, boom, get you, and then boom, just like that. That's the end of the game, see? Get you up real quick. Is he leaving his boy? No, no, no, no, he's got 20, 20, 20, 20. What are we gonna do, play it slow? Yeah! Oh, God. Yes, we are! That's why... Hey, kill check. You can't kill check me. Yes, I'm literally kill checking. I've got 12, how much do you have? I don't have any because we're spectating. Exactly, exactly. See, look at you. Good job, now you're down again, I'm in the right position and you're dead. Nice. Nice suppression. Now I have to come try and save you. No, no, no, just come back. No, that's a bad play. We have plenty of time, the gas is not even rotating in. Oh, God, Timmy. Now, yeah, here we go, now I have to try and come get you, probably die. You should be crawling to me on this rock right now, that's what you should be doing. You got shot one time and you're panicking. You should be... Now, here we go again. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you. Now here you go again. Right, as soon as you're up, where are you going? I'm trying to get an angle here. Good luck, Timmy. I'm fucking dead. I'm fucking dead because of you. Nice. Nice! Yeah, you look back and you're like, oh, dude, I was over here, man. I'm telling you, you got to push up with me. Who's the last one alive? You, but I was one. Exactly. Boom, there we go, another knock. I got 12 kills. And we lose again because of you, because you left. All you had to do was be with me there at the end. I'm going to put that one on you. It was literally your fault, dude. This has got to be little John, huh? Oh, man. That was a good... I mean, that was the first time we ever duo spectated. I actually had fun with that. You want to wrap up the video here? Yeah, that's the end of the video. Listen, we would have won, but I mean, there's nothing you can do about Timmy Tenders. He just doesn't push up. He's not aggressive. And I mean, damn, he's a good guy. I mean, damage and kill check. I thought you were going to take the wheel. You should get you should get a jet ski. Why not? The jet ski the last time I was on one. I mean, it's water. Did you hurt yourself? I mean, I was pretty I was like embarrassed because I flipped. I flipped like in front of our camp and like everyone was watching me. It was pretty embarrassing. What was embarrassing about it? Like, did your shorts come off? What was the embarrassing part? Oh, the fact I flipped the jet ski. You know what I mean? And I couldn't even you know how I couldn't rock it back. You know what I'm saying? Bye. Appreciate the game. Bye. Yeah. Bye. Bye. Bye.
