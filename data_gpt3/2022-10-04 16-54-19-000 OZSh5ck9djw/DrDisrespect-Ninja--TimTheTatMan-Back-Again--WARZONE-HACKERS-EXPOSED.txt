 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Woo! Yeah! Use this program and expose hackers and cheaters. Yeah, you suck, Timmy. But you invite a hacker to your event. That would be something, huh? Ah! All right, man? Hey, guys, Dr. Disrespect here. Hi! Welcome to my YouTube channel. Hope you enjoy the content. Please subscribe to the channel and make sure to watch all of my other videos. Can you hear the music right now? No, you can't. You can't hear the music. So Alex really fucked up. I've got to find somebody else than Alex. I know I've given this guy so many opportunities. Wordle to calm the nerves. Absolutely. Let's have a nice, quiet, calm. Calm. Wordle. Usurp? It's not even a word! It's a stupid word. What is usurp? That cannot be a real fucking word. Holy shit. No wonder, man. That's not a word. What does that mean? I don't even see! Nice. Audio sucks! Ah! Man, someone fire! Holy shit! Behind you! What the fuck are you running from? I'm not in a good mood right now, man. I'm not. Come on! Man, what am I fucking stuck in? I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere. What the fuck, man? What am I stuck on? Didn't have to push. I know, man, but shit! No! What is my guy doing? I need fucking stamina! Dude, no, I can't do this game. Holy shit! This guy still retallenges in the middle! No! Nothing! Nothing. Anybody following this Call of Duty drama? Obviously, the two-time always stays away from... I try to, anyways. But there's actual real hackers and cheaters out there. But then there's people that are accused of hacking. We don't know others. There's clips where it's like, damn, how do you really explain that, etc. I sit back and I just kind of watch. But Doug Censor, aka a two-time Call of Duty champion, supposedly along with some people that he met or whatever, they created this program that counters the cheat programs and basically lets people know who purchased them from a particular site based off their ID number and Activision and all that stuff. Again, I have no idea. I don't want to... Hey, Doug, if you look up my name, let me just go and explain something. I really am that fucking good with a sniper, trust me. But anyways, it's like tonight, Doug is about to use this program and expose... If you use this cheating company, your name will pop up. And he's getting a lot of heat. So I'm kind of interested though to see if he does bring this program and if it starts working, I'd be curious to see how that all unfolds. And anyways, that's the drama. That's your update. I don't know who all went to the Call of Duty Next event. Again, I didn't really watch any of it, but I'd be curious. But imagine not inviting the two-time, but you invite a hacker to your event. That would be something, huh? But at the very end, he just proposed to the most alleged cheater in Warzone. And then afterwards, she took to Twitter to say, I don't like men. And then that was it. That was literally the biggest drama we have seen this past month. Doug, why are you here with NBA 2K but not me? Oh, no. Oh, no. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. I think I'm in. Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Whoa, whoa. Does that not hurt? Doug, where you going, man? Today's going to be a power session. We're playing alongside Timmy, the Tornado Turkey Tenders, and Ninja. Get little Ninja over there, man. You'd love the commercial for the NFL game this weekend. It's time to get a little respect. Now, not everyone's welcome into the Champions Club. But Jimmy G belongs. Welcome back! Nick, Pat, Debo, Fred. They've all earned their respect. We're thrilled to welcome......inner Russell Wilson. Broncos country, let's ride. Let's ride. Let's ride. Let's ride. The Broncos finally have their quarterback, right? Boo's raining down. Booing already? Unbelievable. I like that. Take it from an international gaming icon. These teams are Champions Club caliber. I need you. Let's get it. Russell Wilson. But Russell... Let's go! Tonight, it's game over. Game over. The Niners ride. Oh, yeah. Let's go! Hey. Hey, bro. What's up, bro? Bro. Hey, Loki, bro. How about those cowboys on, bro? Dub you, bro. Your 49ers thing is pretty cool. Oh, thanks. Yeah, but they need... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That felt good. That felt really good. I'm going to cum. I'm going to cum. Holy man. How long has it been? I don't know. Hey, listen, Timmy, before you say anything, Ninja and I, we've been doing this at the highest level from H1Z1 to PUBG Day. I mean, we've been doing this since before you were even born, man. I was better than you at H1. Facts. No, you're Overwatch, like, mid. What's a Chrome splash? Oh, dude, this little Siemens shit I saw, right? It's definitely not Siemens. Throw it down, throw it down, throw it down, throw it down. I mean, what are you thinking? All right, so you throw it, and then you hit sprint, and then you turn into a ball, and then you can hit double jump, like space, space, and then you boom. Yeah. Two of them. One's one shot. Goku's one shot. Got him. Guy on me. Playing basketball. Right now. Knocked one. Oh, baby, baby, baby. You just don't keep getting shot. Put the cap on. No, no, no. You don't want to go to the pool. Honestly, I'm cool down here. That's it. All right. Dude, it was 155 miles an hour, and a cat5 is in the game. Loak, would you take that McLaren with the top down in a hurricane? His top doesn't come off. What? You got a McLaren without a drop top? I'm sorry. Hey, guys. Dude, I... How's that not a head shot? I did. Hit where I want to hit. Oh, here we go again, Timmy. Grab the one you're about to come here. I got to be honest. I got about just maybe a couple more games. I got to switch over to Apex. I got to get my grind to Predators. Oh, I've got a desire to play Apex right now. You know what I mean? Like the rank, it's fun. I saw that squad wipe on TikTok. It was pretty good. Thank you. Glad you're having fun playing Apex, Doc. Yeah, you suck, Timmy. All right, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck out of my game. Oh, no bullshit. I would've been like clip of the year for you. Clip of the year? I just get warmed up, Timmy. Are you kidding me? One in the river in the water going down the river. Did he go down, Doc? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's all the way down in the splash. I dare you to jump down there, Timmy. Go for him, Timmy. I don't fucking know where he is. Jesus, jump in there, Timmy. All right. Dude, what? What the fuck am I playing right here, dude? I just went into a, like, what the fuck? Can't wait to kill a new game and watch Dennis try to 4v1 again. Like he's somehow good at this game still. What do you mean? You died first two games ago and I didn't speak at all. Please, please. When? When? You rejected on Tim and I kept my mouth shut. It was Tim that died first. I tried to save his ass. I kept my mouth shut. Why do you think we dropped off risky real? Oh, please. I dropped you nine boogie bombs. That's the only reason that you didn't get shot. No land where I'm landing. What is? Hey, Timmy. What's going on, man? I just was thinking about how incredible it is on this incredible Wednesday. Who the fuck severed me to me? Why are there eight? Stop. Turn around. Oh my god. Turn around. Who's not hiding their screen? Doc, it's you. Oh shit. Look at that.
