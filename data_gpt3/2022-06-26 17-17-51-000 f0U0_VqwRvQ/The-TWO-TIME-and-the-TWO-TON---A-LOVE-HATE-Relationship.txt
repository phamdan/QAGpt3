Timmy You should have been aware worry I'm on my way up Precision on the way or maybe just take the heli one of the two I'm on my way up I'll be there in two seconds If I get landed out by that stream server and he thirst me I'm going to be on my way up Timmy are you are you okay? I just I had to go reflect so I took a minute and I reflected How you reflecting about just life in general, you know So what happened there? You just ran a heli You just ran a heli You just ran a heli to the helicopter and knocked me. Did you not get the airstrike? I did not the airstrike. I was on the opposite side of top so that was my house and then a stream sniper landed on me and thirsted me so Not the not the first game that I wanted to you know, dip my toes in the water with with caldera, you know That's six in a row That would that would don't count that's oh no address, you know, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no No, we know what the routine is I get it the hell obviously I get to the helicopter first and then I get mounted up How many gin and tongs you have? Seven six just seven minimum. I mean your team won There was a lot We moving slow today moving good, I don't know how but I'm moving real good today There's a guy with no name And he's a brand new level 55 and just let you know just being aware. How do you get this information so quick? I mean he killed me in the three games of A 5.2, yes, we're fresh out of the hangar on that grass seeking Hey Doc. Yeah? Yeah. Hit right above me. Are you gonna angle on me? Oh, I see. I mean, don't they? Like where? The rest was behind me. That don't make sense. On me, on me, on me, Timmy! God! You're so slow! We're not, we're not. Holy shit! And once again, chat, what does this come down to? There's no awareness, no situational awareness. Do I have to, like, I'm going five feet, then I'm turning left, Timmy. You just gotta tell me, right here, under, like give me a fucking comm that you're flying off! Nothing! Timmy, the guy that I'm shooting, Timmy, the guy that I'm shooting is five feet in front of me. I don't need that! I need you to tell me where they are, where you're flying to, you fuck! Unloading one bullet. Fucking hell. Unloading one bullet. Fucking hell, dude. You know, it's not the day, chat. I'm gonna go take another seven days. I gotta go. I need to think about life, reflect. You, you're going to a completely different, it's like I told you to meet me at fucking Chili's, and when you show up at Culver's, you're confused why I'm not there. How would you like me to communicate to you, Timmy? I'm going to Culver's over here. I am at Chili's, you went to Culver's. That's the point I'm making. Is there a specific, I don't know, algorithm or formula in which you want me to project the directions out? Do you like Northwest, Southeast? Do you want numbers? Do you want left and right? Right here with a live ping would fucking hit it. Right here with a live ping. That would have hit me and I would have been able to find him. No, you wouldn't have, because the whole fucking problem is that you're trapped on the other side of the plane, you're trapped on the other side of the wall, and you had no idea how to get to the correct side. What if my side is the correct side? It wasn't. You've died before me. My side was obviously better. We're hiding the screen, right? No way. We're already this much, we're like a married couple right now. Do you not like Chili's? Chili's, the problem I have with Chili's is that it's just, there's too many options. When you open up that menu, it's like eight, nine pages long, right? I have one restaurant that I think of when I think about that. Let's see if you can think of what I'm thinking of. One restaurant where I am overwhelmed when I go there, it's a chain, and I'm overwhelmed because the menu is so big. You know what I'm saying? Let's see. I mean, that's Chili's. No, Chili's is actually smaller compared to this one, believe it or not. It's so big and it's a lot of options. This one, my whole chat's got it. The Cheesecake Factory? Cheesecake Factory, man. Every time I go there, I look at that. Dude, that menu is like a... Never seen more options in my life. How do they have that much food in the back? I mean, the restaurants are always really big for the most part, but it's like... And I kind of get it because you can get anything you want there. You can get like a pizza, you can get like noodles. You can get... The only food they might not have is like a sushi or something. You know what I mean? Hmm. I'm gonna call on this side here. Oh my God. What's up, man? Watch out. So, I'm gonna call on this side here. I'm gonna call on this side here. I'm gonna call on this side here. I'm gonna call on this side here. Damage check. You know, certain hangovers hurt me way worse, but... Hey Timmy, you see the arms today? I didn't see them. Are they big? Oh. You little streamers, man. You got a lot to learn. You got a lot to learn. You just have a lot to learn. Stop looking at my arms. I get it. Knock it off. But we're celebrating inside. Another Warriors Championship. And another incredible day. Side by side. The two time and the two ton. So they put grilled cheese on the outside of it, bro. You're telling me you can't take out a grenade and then put it back in your pocket? Not after you pull the pin. I'm the one that's putting us into a top 10. He blew himself up with a frag grenade. Let me just cut to the chase here. And we lost. Who got us into a top 10 and a top 5 situation, Timmy? It wasn't top 5, there were 6 left. Timmy, where are you going? Dude, I'm like a fucking squirrel. Holy shit. Holy shit. Easy clean up. Is Timmy still flying around not doing anything? Holy shit. Dead again, huh Timmy? I'm making a move, mom. See ya. Gotta watch out for that one. What the? Oh, there's a guy behind. I'm in this game. I'm gonna look up, he could fly right above me. God, I'm so good. Wait, someone's still up here. Crack, crack. Nevermind. I'm back. We got people shooting right here, guys. We got people like right here, you see that? Someone's landing right there. How many times you died this game, Timmy? I don't wanna be that... I don't wanna be that... I don't wanna be that guy, but you might have gotten the wrong guy up. Alright, alright, alright. I don't mean to blame you, you know what I mean? It's just Timmy. It's just Timmy. It's pretty impressive how someone so bad at this game plays this game nonstop. Let me hear this guy, let me hear this guy. Boom, I'm sprinting. I'm sprinting around, sprinting, sprinting, jumping around. Right? Fucking nothing. Game is trash. How long have you been live today? What time? How long have you been live? What do we got? Two and a half hours already? I got 20 more minutes.
