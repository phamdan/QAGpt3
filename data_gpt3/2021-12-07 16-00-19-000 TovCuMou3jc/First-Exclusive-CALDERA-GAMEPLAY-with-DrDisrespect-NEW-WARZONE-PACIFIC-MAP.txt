 Go, go, go, go, go! I still remember when you paid my life back. Yeah! Beautiful, beautiful. This airplane's kind of sick. A rare inside early access look at Caldera. Caldera. Caldera. Caldera. Caldera. This, I mean, Doc, this is our first look right here, bro. This is it. A little inside sneak peek. A little early access, huh? Ladies and gentlemen. Now, this is not normal, technically. This is more like a rebirth, right? Resurgence. So, Doc, I lowkey kind of want to explore the map on this first one because this is our first time looking at it. What do you think? Well, you got to do it right now. You got to do it right now. Do it right now? How am I supposed to take everything in? Yeah. I want to win the very first map, first game ever on Caldera. Okay. We can try to win. Did I need to turn Phil on? Because I didn't. I turned it off. I don't got time to have randoms. Land if you can and just like run around and just look at how much brighter everything looks though. That is beautiful. That is beautiful. This is what I'm looking for. The map looks really good. Huh? Looks incredible. Incredible. Come over here, Doc. Look, like, invert, invert, this toilet. I don't think I would have been able to see in there. Now I can actually. I'm sure they've taken the feedback from the previous map and said, okay, we know what we need to do. You and I are first ever game, right? Just drop in. Warzone Pacific, Caldera history. This is new, obviously. Oh, whoa, whoa, boom, boom. Yeah, don't panic you guys. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. That's where you're going. You got your parachute? No. Yeah. Okay, then let's just go. Sounds good. I'm going right to that. I don't think anybody's going there. I got my machine pistol out. Is that actually machine pistol? Yeah. Oh my goodness. That is crazy. Craziest recoil I've ever seen. Let me give it a little. Oh, shit. Yeah. Can you come up to me? I think we just hold hands here. Okay. I kind of like the layout of this building. Looks like a fun spot. Fighting. Oh yeah. This thing's nuts. What is this thing? Oh, ho, ho, ho. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's on us. It's on us. On, on, on. Come here. What do you mean? Under, under. I hear. You don't hear that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. One bullet. One bullet on me. Climbing up here. That's Noah. That's Noah. See ya. He's, there's something on the left. Nice. Guys, down below. Down below. Down below. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. And down below too. I got the guy down below. I got him broke. I got him broke. Dude, they're in squads. We're in duos. I got him broke on me. Okay, self-sweat way too fast. I jumped out. Was it heavy building though? So they're four, Doc. They're four, bro, we're only two. Well... Hey, bring him... Bring the shotty. Can you play low with me here? Yeah, yeah. Okay, Noah's coming back right now. Okay. Wanna go upstairs Morph200? Shot at him? Yeah, I mean, you can open this up... I have an bolt of bullets. Hold on. Bled, blled, eu bicycle. I just blew that up and I marked him, did you see it? Yeah, yeah. I think he jumped out. Oh, he jumped- Right here, right here, right here! Right, right, to my right. No, no, no, right here. Getting pushed. Got him. Got two of them, got two of them. Come on, brilliant! Another one. Yeah. Yeah. I'm making it look real easy. Look at this guy, see it? Last one. Look at him. There he is. Never played the game before. Reality check, right? We're in a 250- We're in a 250,000 dollar tournament. 250,000 dollar tournament. I see him, I see him, I see him. Right here, look at him. Yep, got him, got him, got him. He's just down, he's down. Oh, that's right, huh? Another one, another one, another one. That guy's crack, crack. One shot, one shot, literally. I hit him, I hit him seven times, Doc. I'm getting aimed at in the back, aimed at in the back. That's an airplane. What the- I got my loady, I got my loady, I got a- Maybe I should have kept that legendary bar, but this thing feels good. Can you get your loady? I'm gonna go for it right now. Do you want to go back inside, maybe? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so. Our first game, start with little w. We're 2v4 right now, Doc, literally. And we're better than them all. What is this thing? Cluster Strike, I got a Cluster Strike. Any way you can melee? You want to melee? Both these windows? Sure, just like a test of friendship. Yeah, because I don't have my melee binded, you know? Where is he? Here's one. Boom! Hit him. I downed him. If you can finish that, that's Joe-wo. Right there, Doc. Nice kill. Shit on Joe-wo! Got a guy down below. Right here, right here, right here! Knocked one right here. I don't know what FaZe Blue is doing. I'm third-partying. We're toxic. You see him pinging right there, Doc? Yeah, yeah. They're coming from there. There's Joe-wo and the boys. Yep, look at him. He's one shot, he's one shot. Yeah, I hit him flesh. I got like a- He's underneath. Oh, he's blood, he's blood. He's gonna rotate the other way. He's got a- Nice. We gotta go, buddy. Okay. He's right here. He's directly under us. I'm gonna kinda hop. I'm hopping to the building in front, Doc. They're all over- They're all in the boat. They're all right here. I'm trying to- We gotta kinda get into the boat here without them seeing. I'm gonna make a move for it, Doc. Hit one all the way across. Getting in, Doc. You're getting in? I'm getting under. I wanna play into this boat. They're right above us right here. I hear them. Yep. One bullet. Nice. I got him up there, Doc. No, no, no, Doc! Oh, that's a full team right there. That's pitbull in there, man. Nice try for what it's worth. Man. These guys, I'm pretty sure that- Yeah, don't run in squads, Doc. Everyone here's running squads and you and I were duo, man. I know. I know. I think we did really well right there. I agree. First ever game on Caldera. Right. Well, I mean, while we're spectating here and watching the end, we got the boys, Lucky, Repulse, Evan, and Biffle, so- Yeah, that's the team we ran into. This is the squad we're running into, right? Some legends in the war zone space. What do you think of the guns and stuff, dude? So far, I'm not impressed with the Kar98. Hey, that ground loot shotty that I picked up though. I mean, that thing was- Oh, Doc, I got guns. I want to try, bro. Do we do a little fill? I think next time we do fill. Yeah. Just so we have a little more of a chance. All right, Doc, wrap it up here, man. First thoughts on Caldera, the new map. Thoughts? Obviously, we didn't get to see the full scale of this map. We saw docs. But just the sort of design of docs and the look of the game, the feel of the game. That was good. That was fun. Whips. Where's the keybind for that? Because I'm not bound to single fire here. Alternate fires B. It says it's B, bro, but I swear to God I was hitting it there, but it wasn't working. Nah, you're fat fingering the space bar, the V out of panic. All right, I'm here. Jesus, did you break your door? Huh? Did you break your door? Nah, I'm strong, bro. Impressive, right? All right, second game, Doc. Let's get it! This auto-mating has zero recoil. Is it an MP rockin' on your MP40? Oh, mine are probably charging. I took a picture of some pros and that's what I'm using. What you're saying, Bobby, is that you took a screenshot of my stream and the MP40 got it. Wait, what's this auto class, Doc? Yeah, hit me with that, Doc. Yeah, yeah, yeah. G28 Compensating. Muzzle, barrel, ZAC 600mm BFA. Optic, 2.5X. Stock, ZAC skeleton. Underbarrel Carver foregrip. Magazine, 6.5mm Sakura 45 round mag. Ammunition lengthened. Rear grip, polymer grip. And then perk, spotter. And then the perk 2, fully loaded. I feel like you did a better job than Morgan Freeman. Jesus, what's this thing have, a V12? It's good, so I don't know what this thing is. This thing's got a straight pipe Lamborghini engine. Oh, my God. You hear us coming up? I'm on it. Boom, boom, boom. Finally got your Jeep in the game, huh? Do you see restrictions applied to the loadout? Yeah, yeah. I wonder what that is. I was thinking it was a weight capacity for Demi. But I'm... Oh, come on. Not for you. Where we going, boys? That's the end, like, way out. I don't think people are going to stretch this far. I'll go there too. Might as well. We have the thing. Let's see what you got. F***, yeah. F***ing mover. Hello. Whoa, he just got ran over by the train. Oh, my God. Let's go. I think we're dead, brother. I don't think we make it out here. I think we can outrun this. Go, Demi, go. Go, go, go. Oh, yeah, easy. Easy. Oh, no. No, no. Come on, come on, come on. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. That's got to be whips. I'm reloading. Who the f*** is this, bro? Oh, my God. Go, go, go, go, go. No. No. Oh, my God. I don't know who that is. Wait, Bobby, what happened to you? You're dead too. I spawned in a plane out of the gulag. I couldn't control it. I ran into a tree. What the f*** happened? Wait, is that serious? You spawned in a plane? I swear I spawned in a plane. I didn't. I couldn't control it. I crashed into a tree and died. I'm so f***ing far. It's a war zone. Oh, my God. Automaton, automaton, automaton. Automaton, automaton. Let's go. Automaton. What? Bobby, are you trying to lose right now? I spawned in a plane on the other side of the map. I don't know what I... And you fly and get out? Like, what are you doing right now? I jumped out of the plane. I need you to be here. I need you to be locked in. Alright. What? Oh, my God. That's a full team. Holy s***. I think my YouTube video for this is going to be spectating solos for the first time. Spectating Caldera for the first time in history. Spectating Caldera for the first time in history. Spectating Caldera for the first time in history. Spectating Caldera for the first time in history. That's a good idea if I die off real quick. I'm not going to give you any credit for that. Alright? The first ever. The first ever. Here we go! Here we go! Yeah, yeah. Right here. Look at this guy over here. Little nade. Little nade on that. Boom. Got you. Oh, I'm liking this. I got your back. Yeah! That's how I just died. I still remember when you came by like f***ing three years ago and gave me like, I still remember when you came by like f***ing three years ago and gave me like, Oh my God. Oh my God. I didn't push it with you guys, my bad. I didn't push it with you guys, my bad. Yeah, I didn't pull that. Oh, to my right. Yeah, he's one shot. Nice, nice. I think we should. This team's floating right here. Yeah, yeah. Hit scan it. Boom. Hit once. There you go. Oh my. Hey, this car 98 is kind of sick. Oh, baby, baby, baby. Can I get on one of these gunners? Oh, I can. Yeah. We're going to get some. Oh, I'm going to get some. Oh, I'm going to get some. Oh, I'm going to get some. Oh, I'm going to get some. Yeah. Where's this guy? All right. All right. All that's game. Dude, I cannot shoot. There's no way. I'm keeping it steady. Beautiful, beautiful. Dude, this thing is hard to shoot. Load the gun. Oh. Oh. What a fast as a car. I mean. God, that's stupid. I can't believe that. I'm literally going to do this. No recall. They can just. Oh, this airplane's kind of sick. He probably will. I might just do it. I might do an AR with you. The chopper in Verdant wasn't under fire or anything, right? That's actually something different. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. The chopper wasn't under fire or anything, right? That's actually something different with this one too. Great observation, Jimmy. Thanks, Doc. At least we lost to the winners, I guess. Damn. That was an astronaut in Holly's squad. So, champs, that concludes our rare limited edition inside early access look at Caldera. The brand new war zone map. Coming this Wednesday. Tomorrow, that is. What are some of the things I like? Obviously, the map is. It's beautiful. I could see things. Can I hear things? No. No, I can't. But boy, oh boy, I can see things. That feels good. It'll be interesting to see some of the meta that comes with these weapons. I mean, there's 50 million attachments. I don't know what's going to happen there. The hitscan sniper, the car 98. That thing's lethal. And I got a feeling. Clip season is about to begin from the two time. Hey, if you like this video, please give it a little thumbs up. If you really like it, give it two thumbs up. That requires you to create a new YouTube account in order to do that. And I hope you do. Please subscribe to the channel. And you know what? We'll be back with more videos. And you know what? We'll be playing this map. This new warzone game. Every single day. Monday, Wednesday, Friday. It's going to be showtime material. You better buckle in! Damn! What a year we have ahead of us. Yeah. I thought we'd take a little look at the new season one battle pass. For Caldera. What is it, Alex? Caldera? Caldela? Caldera. That's what it is. Let's just take a look. Some of the skins, some of the rewards. As we go through here. Some of the new weapon skins. Ooh, I like that. Rustic Titanium Blue. That'd look good on a Lamborghini right there, huh? Versailles. I see a skin that I really like. I'm going to take a look at the 3D model. In fact, let's just take a look at one of these guys. You know, I'll tell you one thing. The skins in warzone. They just look really good. There's just so much detail. The aesthetics are just so nice. Very impressed. What's this one? I gotta take a look at this one. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I want something deadly. Hold the line! The reflections. I can see my own reflection off of it. How do I look? I look good. Let's see what this big guy is. The Francis Skin. You guys got a cape? Also, let's take a look at all the operators. For the new season on the new map, Lucas Preview. I like what this guy's about. Roland. Daniel. That's going to be the new skin right there. Easy headshots. You
