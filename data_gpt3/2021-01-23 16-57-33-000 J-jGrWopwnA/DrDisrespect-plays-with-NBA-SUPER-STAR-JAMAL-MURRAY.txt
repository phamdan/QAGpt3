 Champion Club. Oh, I can hear my set. That surround sound. We have a new surround sound set up in the Champion Club. What kind of speakers are these? Ladies and gentlemen, I can't even think. I'm hearing my sound. Hey, Alex! Alex! Where's the package? Yeah, the Mountain Dew Papa John's package. Come here, let me talk to you. That's 6 foot 8. 37 inch, I believe. I don't really want to get into it. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. Alex, I can still hear myself. Now, wait a second. You see? I gotta get the job done, Alex. No, I don't even want to hear it. I don't even want to hear it. You complete your tape. You know what? Mountain Dew Papa John's, Champion's Club, the two-time international video gaming superstar. We don't need you today. Go home. Listen, ladies and gentlemen, today is going to be an explosive night of high octane athletic schism. Obviously, we're waiting on some things to arrive in the arena, and once they do, get it? Once they do, we grab the competition and we snap them up. Let's get back inside of the command center. Let's get the job done. We're back. Ladies and gentlemen, Champion's Club. You got to power up. And you got to play on. Ladies and gentlemen, that's exactly what we're going to do in the next hour. Brought to you by Mountain Dew and Papa John's Pizza. We're just kind of waiting on Jamal Murray from the Denver Nuckees. I'm supposed to be receiving a package from Mountain Dew and Papa John's. Something magical is inside of it. But I'm going to hold off. I'm kind of waiting on Jamal. I mean, he's still working on it. I think we're going to be jumping into Fortnite. That's what I'm thinking. One of the best basketball players in the league is playing with Jamal Murray. What? Don't tell him that. He's going to be pissed off. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. Alex, you came back. Is that the package? This is something else. Okay. Put it on the ground right there. I don't want to get near you right now. I'm still upset. Pretty impressive, huh? I bet you guys can't guess what color this box is. Anybody? Take a guess. Boom. This is the Mountain Dew Papa John's Quick Order Controller. That's what I'm being told. Warm up game? Yeah, you're right. Let's get it. Warm up game. We're going to Arena Solos. Trust me, you're going to love this. We're in Open League Division 4. That's probably the closest thing you can go before you get sponsored by FaZe. Literally. I mean, I'm literally I'm a pro. Just watch. Should we press this button? Not half. I'll take this guy. Definitely not. Who, by the way, is that black guy? On the Mountain Dew, Papa John's controller, the quick order button, supposedly that's what it's called. Let's see what we got. Let's turn it on. Whoa! Papa Diaz? Champions club. Jesus! Can you hear me Jamal? I'm gonna keep pressing the button. Champions club. Champions club. With Papa John's power up play on bundles you can save on any two Papa Diaz and two 20 ounce Mountain Dews. Jesus! Okay. Man! Hey I'm gonna tell you this right now. Quick order button, it works. Jamal's building man. Get him out here. Jamal's gonna do everything. Watch. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know. Move. I don't know what I'm doing. See ya. Bye bye. This is the game we win. Guaranteed. I'm putting a personalized guarantee on it. I'm gonna take that kill for me. The dude thank you for the ten in Super Chat. Big Blue Nation supporting the two time champ and Jamal tonight. Give him the love tonight. Logan Dodge taking the 4.99 in Super Chat. Man did you get your quick order controller? I did. Whee! It's dope. Are you using it right now? I am. You're actually playing on it right now? I am yeah. Don't worry. There's nothing. Nobody. There's nothing there huh? There's nothing there eh? Alright then. I'm not building too much. Hit him once. There you go baby. Get out. Yes sir. Get out of here. Get out of here. Shot drop. Gotta be a bot or something though. I don't know what was going on here. I think it was a bot versus a bot. Another joke. Fortnite 2020. Wow I'm trash. I missed every shot. That's one shot. Come on Alex! You know my level baby. Oh both these guys are injured. Oh man. I'm so bad. I'm the worst. I'm so bad. I might uninstall Fortnite. I mean that's not that bad. My homies laughing at me. Alright Jamal! Have a good night. Yes sir. Have a good night. Firm handshakes to Mountain Dew and Papa John's. Again power up and play on bundle. You can save on any two Papadias and two 20s. Duck all the popcorns out of the VIP level concession stand. Really? Let's go over there right now. Firm handshakes to every single one of you for being inside of the arena this late. We almost got the job done. It's going side by side Jamal Murray. Maybe we needed the joker to join us as well. For little trio's action maybe next time. In the meantime ladies and gentlemen enjoy the rest of your evening. We'll see you manana.
