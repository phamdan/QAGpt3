 I'm gonna kinda float in between. Hey Phoenix, you honestly sound like Dr. Disrespect, bro. You sound like a younger Dr. Disrespect, it's kinda crazy. Like a younger in his prime. Dude, no doubt. The two time champion, you know? The six foot eight, gaming great. Woo! Wait, is he six eight? I know he's tall, but is he that tall? Six eight, six eight, thirty seven in vertical leap. It's not a joke. God damn. Alright, let's get it, huh? I like your mic. I paid four thousand dollars for it. Okay, Doc. Okay, Doc! Let me get warmed up! Get him, Doc. Okay, Doc! Shoot! Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow! I'm dodging, because I was supposed to play with my buddy and I pressed start the match cube accident. Fair enough. I feel like that's an excuse. Nah. I feel like you don't got the guts. You don't want to get the job done. Okay, let's cringe. Player five, you know what's cringe? What the fuck? Huh? Player five, you know what's cringe? Bro, shut up. Watch your mouth! What the fuck? I'm just messing around, man. It's fine. Yeah, this is amusing. One enemy remaining. Nice. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! I ain't listening. When I'm going to feel good, I want to feel good. And boy, oh boy, I feel good. Hey champs, I mean, take a look at the MVP's in a row. What do you want me to do? It's almost like we don't even need to stop. Let's just push all the way through A and suffocate them in their own spawn. I'm literally not going to stop this round. Launching smoke. You know Sage is on network. You know Sage is on network. One enemy remaining. You sound like Dr. Disrespect. Astra, come on man. You talking about the two times six foot eight gaming great? Definitely not. Yo, is that actually you? Wait. Yo, this is actually him. Come on, baby. Oh, let's go. We got to win this. Come on. Let's go, baby. Come on. Last player standing. One enemy remaining. Nice. I mean, champs, if it isn't obvious, this is my game. One enemy remaining. Take one shot and that's all we ask, right? My aim is kind of snappy. It's kind of A. Sometimes it's kind of snappy. Fight down mid. Last player standing. 30 seconds left. One enemy remaining. Nice. Attackers win. It's a whole other ball game out here, man. What do I do? What do I do? I got him. Should I push through? Yeah, I'll push through. Yeah, I got him. I can disarm it. I can disarm it. Where is it? I got it. I got it. Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, the champions club. Hey, oh, no, I'm dodging. All the four. Just fucking dodging, bitch. Just fucking do it. Your teammate is shit, bro. Boo shit. Your fucking teammate. Yo, fellas, what you think? Do you guys think I survived the whole entire pack, that new Prime 2.0 whole set? I did. All right. I'll live for that if he's bad. I'll live for that. I'm fucking dodging. Dodging. I don't know what's going on over here. They're having a conversation about dodging this and that, whatever. I don't know. Can I get a happy birthday in Penguin? Thanks, Doc. No, you don't. Careful now. Let's go. You're about to get that tickle yell moment. It's kind of interesting that the audio is actually going through my nostrils and my throat, you know? Just to show them. That voice sounds familiar. 30 seconds left. One enemy remaining. You thought you'd put up a fight. Oh, baby. I'm going to get this down too, baby. Your star shines bright. Hey, that sky was high. Give it a bug, bro. Probably get up and suck your dick for that. Thanks. Hey, guys. Come on down. Welcome to my brand new gaming show, Valorant Placement Matches with a two-time international video gaming superstar. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Aim high with a $10 donation. This is the moment. Let's go, Doc. I want to see crosshair placement on point. Patience on point. Map awareness on point. You're coming out of placements plat three, and that's the end of it. Make it happen, Doc. No questions asked. Quote of the day. Quote of the month. That's the type of energy I'm looking for today. I'm not... I'm going to write this in my chat. I'm going to write this in his chat. The black steel, aka the bulletproof mullet, dripping between my shoulder blades all the way down into my butt crack, down the inner thighs, all the way down to the Achilles and my heels directly onto the floor below. Things are getting slippery. Jesus. That's done. That's done. That's done. Locked in today. One more, one more. Just get warmed up, you know? Yo, if we shoot the other team, we should win. So try to do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Doc, can you give my signed book an Italian kiss? Sure. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey, uh. Man, wow, wow, wow. Still silver one or is he gold? Yeah, no, I'm silver three. We started off in bronze, went all the way to silver three. Probably could get gold in like three or four games, you know? What a stream. What a day. God dang, man. Snappy day. Doc, thank you for your streams. It's been rough after my car accident and dealing with other health issues for the past few months. So thanks for being you a renown prime. Multivitamins, Gatorade's, get your electrolytes up, cup of noodles, you know, get the nice warm sodium into your body. Some yoga, some stretching, maybe a 10 minute nighttime meditation experience. Go outside, look at the moon. Understand that it's colder actually in the moonlight than it is in the darkness. I don't know. Let that wrap around your head for a little bit. What I'm saying is. The power's coming to you.
