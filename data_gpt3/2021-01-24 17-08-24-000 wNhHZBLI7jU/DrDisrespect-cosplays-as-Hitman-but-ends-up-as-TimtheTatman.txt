 The name is Dr. Disrespect. We're playing this game so listen, there's a little update on Hitman. Never played one, never played two. I've seen footage, seen gameplay. I like the tone, I like the color palette a lot. Flake the square with a five, says ten. The tap man looks like you. Bro, bro, bro, low key bro. Bro, I don't know what you, I don't know what you, bro. I could do Tim the tap man impersonation. I don't know like, what would he, he's got, it's all about the voice. But I'd have to listen to him and then like really practice. That's what I'm gonna do tonight. Take off the headset doc, we all know there's a dent on the head. There's not a dent. I spent five years growing my ponytail and doc cut his off. Now what? That mechanic is in your way. Sneak up and subdue him quietly. T, disguise. Before you move on, I suggest you hide your tracks. You have a much greater chance of success if your actions go undetected. G dump. Hey, hey, listen, the key bindings in my mind are just expanding. This is how you pull off bald. Timmy needs to take notes. People marked with the thread icon will find you suspicion. Make sure you do, you do not, they do not spot you. You have been compromised. Try and lose them and change your disguise. Okay, I'll just make sure you do not spot you. Hey, how you doing? Don't mind me, I'm just gonna, we could just kind of go by you. Yeah. Your target is down. Now head calmly towards an exit. Well that went real smooth. Mission training complete. Went real smooth. Can't wait to jump into the actual game now. We should be blowing through the hardest difficulty with ease. Trust me. Here we go, here we go, here we go. You sure you know how to skydive? Never been once. All right, good luck. What the hell? What happened? I pressed the buttons. No, I needed your outfit. Get up out of there. See ya. Let's get into round two. Bring on the next mission. So kill Alexa and find the case file. Got it. And do you see that guy with the bald head? I did not. Oh, never mind. That is Phineas Whitman. How you doing? Famous private investigator. If I can get ahead and then steal this detective's identity and then go in as detective doc with this easy? I think that's the way to do it. That's Madame Carlisle taken care of. Time to get the file on Arthur Edwards. First guess. And just like that, he's fucking out of here. Job done. World record fashion. One of the fastest playthroughs in the history. And just because I can. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Bye bye. Come on! Go! Yes! Let's see the setup for this one. Hey! What's this? We got a little club going on here? Yes, I did. Look, get me inside. So I can save. If you want to get into the club, I can get you in for free. Allergy pills can remove some of that tension. Follow me. That's the most creative way to do it. The allergy pills. Hey, scared now, aren't you? What the fuck? Roger. Yeah, easy. Bye guys! Might be losing the shim or something. I just got a cut, so it's gonna, like my skin's sensitive, so it's probably gonna show wrinkles and shit. I'm glad. It's gonna look infected for a little bit. Looking good, man. Looking good. Thank you. Both targets down. Good. Just give me a second and I'm in. You can now access the core 47. The data core. We got to figure out how to open this bad boy up. Roger. How's the game doc? I feel like I'm in a speed run tournament. The guys at IO at Interactive are like, we've got to do better. Got to make it harder. Sebastian. What the fuck is this? So, I followed the data referring to the two of you from their system before we publish the rest. Okay. Delete the files. When you press that button, it's up there and the whole world will know. There's no undo 47. Okay. This will shut the ICA down for good. Let's shut them down. Upload. Maybe it's time for a job. Shit. I missed that. I can hold the doors for a little while. All right. There's a hard ass criminal out there. We need to apprehend him. Okay. How about this fucking coin right next to you? Just like that. We're out of here. Not to be seen. To touch. Not to be fucked with. This game's easy. The hardest level. We're speed running and we're setting a record. 47 has one weakness. Me. Okay. Your deal. That kind of power always comes with a price. What's yours? I think you know. My family. Uh oh. I know what you did. After all these years. Get up. Is this the last mission? Champs. All right. Eliminate Arthur Edwards. Come down to this. An antidote produced at Ether's R&D site in Johannesburg was stolen by Lucas Grey during his assault on the facility in order to unlock 47's hidden memories. In his current version the serum is a bl- It always stops. Wait. What? Hold on. I know. I know. Hold on. Let me just- Stop. Stop. I'm going to like think of a number just sort of off the top of my head. Let me just think here. If I were to really look at this keypad in front of me. Just kind of think about the number. What could it be right off the bat? All right, I'm lost. Okay, here we go. It's cold out here isn't it? Get the fuck out here! Get your ass out here! Get your ass on the ground! I want to try this shotty. I think it works pretty good. I'm right through that door. There you go. Perfect. Look at this guy. Look at these two. Oh man, did anybody hear that? No, I didn't hear that. Fred, uh- Fred, are you okay? Let me just clean- Let me clean it by the rest of my shoes here. What the fuck? Uh-oh. I don't suppose there's any point calling for help. No way! Well played, Miss Burnwood. Go on then. Do your thing. Eliminate Arthur. Boom. Fit. Woo! Hey! 33rd in the world. I'll take it, baby. In the world. First try. Not even a big deal. Ah, ladies and gentlemen. That was fun. Kind of easy. Obviously, 22nd in the world. Fastest time. Most points. On the hardest difficulty. First run. Don't even- Like, just- We're cruising. I mean, barely- I mean, I don't know. Barely even trying. Just comes natural. Ladies and gentlemen, Champions Club members. Appreciate the donations, the commitments, the recommitments all day long. Agent Disrespect, we win in. We got the job fucking done. And boy, oh boy, did we look good doing it. Tonight, grab them. Taste them, understand them. Then fucking snap them. Enjoy the rest of your night. Be prior. Thank you for the 499. Doc, what's your most hated game of all time? Probably Fortnite. That
