 Alcoholic Adley. Thank you for the Australia, mate! Hey doc, I just checked into the 6- uh- 5 Arena Hotel! Hello there, mate! Hello there, mate! I just checked into the six foot eight- Hello there, mate! You have any Jim Beam white whiskey on top? Today we're gonna be talking about how to do an Australian accent. So for example in the word like change like this sound like like boy like like like I don't know Mike I like you boy like like like like like boy like like like butter butter I like what I like but I like you like like hey I like you hey there mate I like you but I'm way better better better better but I'm way better hey mate I like you but I'm way better saying what are you saying ladies and gentlemen now we're jumping into a brand new game a brand new experience in the online gaming community player unknowns I got something else we're gonna put up it's it's like it's not an excuse it's just a reality check okay it feels like you're always watching me oh why do yeah yep yeah yes God oh This guy. Yeah. Yeah. Easy. Take one time. There you go. There you go. Let me get this. Let me get this type. Oh, my God. How that feel? Hit him first. Not hit this guy in his face. So we got to see. The game still a piece of shit. His whole head. I saw the animation. Like that. Like that. Nothing's changed. It's gotten worse. Playing in a fucking another real. It's so fucking funny. But what am I playing? And what the fuck is this game? What is it? I don't know, man. Like a nine year old can come up with a better combat system than this game. It's just so one dimensional, generic, boring, predictable. Like just. Yes. I come by show him, but he don't show me. I think game hasn't changed. Staring at the stream, too. I mean, it's just fucking stream snipers after stream snipers, man. I did it. The game hasn't changed at all. And I'm already starting to get fucking pissed off. Like he's not even shooting this guy. He has no interest in shooting this guy. This is the only thing I know what to do. And I can't win a game of PUBG either. Eight stream snipers in what, four games? It doesn't make any sense. The game's never made any sense. I hate the game. I hate. I literally I fucking hate this game. I hate how it feels. I hate how sluggish it feels. Boring enough. That's why people laugh. Hey guys, you wanna go see a joke? Let's go watch PUBG eSports. Coming back to this game, it makes you want to throw up all over your keyboard. It's so pristine and I'm not afraid to throw up all over. Who the fuck's playing this game anymore? Like who are you? Who, who are you? That's still playing this game. You know, we'll have about 20, 25 stream snipers this game. And you know what? It don't matter. How come I shoo him but he don't shoo me? Blue Balls Entertainment, how come I shoo him? But you don't shoo me. Champions Club. The year is 2021. For $4.99 you can join the Champions Club. For free you can subscribe to the channel.
