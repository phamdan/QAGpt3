 Why are you ripping Call of Duty so much? Listen, I just point out the obvious. Plus, you know, once I got banned from the Purple Snakes platform, they like secretly shadow banned and stopped talking to us and all that stuff. And to me, like I took it personal. Like what the fuck do we made multiple commercials? We did lots of deals and to exclude us from anything and to not allow, like, trust me, there's just, you know, design half the maps for advanced warfare. Like we've done a lot with the franchise, right? And for them to turn the cold shoulder like that, trust me, I took it personal, right?

A lot of the industry is phony, but more so, I'll tell you right now, there's a lot of phoniness inside of that little, that corporation. A lot of phoniness. Of course, I'm gonna rip their game.
