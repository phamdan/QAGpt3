 I want like a... a sports car, exotic Lamborghinis, Ferraris, whatever. Okay? So think about a game like this man. It's about violence, speed, and momentum. This might be the next title for Midnight Society, who knows? But imagine a sports car game that had like H1Z1 type, like the car, it's like H1Z1 on steroids. Essentially in like brand new graphics. In like a downtown district. You know? And you're just racing around all these streets, kinda like GTA. When you're like high speed, but these would be like even kinda over the top arcadey. In the sense of acceleration and burnouts and shit. You know? Almost like a need for speed type of feel. But then you hop out, bop bop bop, super precision, shields and shit. Lost me at shields. When I say shields, I'm not thinking, I'm not talking Apex shields, you know? I'm talking a good balance of like, maybe like Warzone-ish. But a little bit faster than Warzone. So it's something in between H1Z1 and Warzone. But you know what the fights in H1Z1 were... I mean obviously like, it was... Unless you two tap somebody. See that's the thing man, you're like bop bop, that guy's dead, jump right back in your car, right? I like that. I almost feel like H1Z1, that's kinda where... They didn't evolve fast enough... The game. In terms of how they're handling like healing and shielding and shit. We just jump in it, huh? We'll kinda, we'll catch up on some of these trailers. Oh god. Let's get this mission started. Time to end this! Aspire! Double... Saber! I'm just on another level. What?! Do I gotta get my lawyers on these guys? It looked cool, it looked cool. I like how that robot spins. It stays very parallel with the ground, like it's perfect. It doesn't like lean over, like you know, just zzzzzzzzzt. And then already has its arm in the position to shoot straight down. That's a nice settle polish touch that doesn't get past the two time. I wanna see it one more time. That's good animation. I like that animation. Hey, I'm kind of excited to play that one, man. That's good. It's just gonna be a nice... We're going deep into... Like I might play that one at like nighttime. That might be a nighttime one. This would be a fun game to play on like a super hard level. Figure out the patterns of how to just destroy areas. Uh oh. Oh, Jesus. Oh man. Oh, Jeff. Is it Gio for Jeff? What happened to Apex predator grind? That's what I came here for. Fucking... Holy shit. It's the same map. Apex has been around for four years now. Okay, let me take a break. So I don't lose too many brain cells. Let's just have some one off content for now. I had nothing. And then this city became my home. It deserves to feel safe. I mean, is this... Like is this on Android only or is it iPhone too? Like again, it kind of sucks that we're not watching 1080p or 4k. Because maybe that game does look good, you know? No, it doesn't. Shredder's Revenge. Introducing the six player mode, local and online. Boom, boom, boom. Man, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles though. In the arcade. Back in the 90s. That was an all time classic arcade machine. Saint Rose. Trying to make a comeback, huh? You got to give this studio a lot of guts. You know what I mean? Like who's their number one contender? Like good luck. But hey, you know what? You got to give the studio and this franchise some credit. I mean, they're trying to stick in there. They're trying to be a competitor to GTA, man. Maybe there is an opportunity there to do things differently and better. And from what I'm seeing though, I don't know if they're doing things that are like different enough. I don't know. I couldn't tell you. And I don't want to. Don't gotta. Not gonna do it. Not gonna. Try to be as unique as you want to be. You could be as unique as you want to be in the game. That's their that's their angle. Got it. That might be interesting to get like. What's this? I already like it. Yeah, I already like it. I didn't see this first time seeing it. I love this. I love the look of this place. It's got a layer of the effects too. The effects too. Like fog and mist and. I like that. Whatever that game is, I like it. New guns, new gears, enemies. Boom! New environment mods. I can't. New, you can't read this fast enough, huh? Outriders World Slayer. Welcome to the biggest world ever in the history of world dem- Slide in. 3v3 combat. Throw magical. Disappear right behind him. Kick him in his back and then cut his body in half. Or burn him alive. Sprint towards him. Butt naked. Boom! Jesus. I think at this point, like I want to play games that like visually just kind of are taking things to the next level. I think when I see a game that is not at a visual level that I am like. Wanting to play at this particular moment in my hot shot illustrious video gaming career. I'm just like I get turned off real quick, you know? Anyone's not coming to mind champs? Oh, we didn't even see the Call of Duty. I mean, it just like I think it's the VFX that this engine just can't pull off, man. Like look at that water. I mean, let's really dissect this man. I'm telling you. I feel like this they the the Call of Duty engine radiant. They're still using radiant. Fantastic engine to quickly build maps and stuff. But like in terms of artists and VFX and I mean the reflections are kind of getting decent. You know, I mean they're decent. Like don't get it mistaken. I'm not speaking to the talent of the VFX. I'm speaking to the talent of the VFX. Don't get it mistaken, I'm not speaking to the talent of the art or any of that. I'm speaking directly of the performance of what this engine is capable of doing. And how it's been kind of pushed to the max for a while now. Right? I think it just gets twinkered just a little bit each year. Just a little. Just a little. That actually looks pretty good right there. It's a new engine, Doc. That's it's radiant. Don't get it mistaken. I don't know. I don't know. Not really too into the single players. For Call of Duty, you know, never, never really were was really about the MP. How's the MP? How's the MP and now now and now Warzone Battle Royale. How are those? I think that I think the gameplay is going to be good. I just got a feeling the gameplay is going to be good. I think the gameplay is going to be good. I just got a feeling the gameplay is going to be good. You know, I hope so. I hope so. Adam, thank you for the 10 and super chatty doc. My dad passed away in October and then my house burned down in February. Myself, wife and kids made it out. Okay. Your streams have definitely helped me through this time. You are the goat.
