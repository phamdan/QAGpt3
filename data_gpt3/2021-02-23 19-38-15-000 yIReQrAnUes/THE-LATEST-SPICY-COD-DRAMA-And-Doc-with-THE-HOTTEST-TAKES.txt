 Marcus R. with a $5 super chat donation. Hey doc, any comments on the Nick Merks and Huskers beef? That's the first I heard of this man. Talk to me, what is it? Oh, Jakey Pooh Bear. Let me give you a little inside look on some production. Right? He unfollowed me on Twitter. So I don't know. I guess he actually doesn't like me. Din, din, din, din, din. Din, din, din. See, that's where you could have done something like that, Jake. Could have really spiced this up. Pew, pew, what's going on folks? As per usual, welcome back to more Esports Talk. We have seen more trash talk. That being Huskers versus Nicky Meo, my Merks. Din, din, din, din, din. Din, din, din. Play with Tim and Nick? Nick doesn't like me. He unfollowed me on Twitter. So I don't know. I guess he actually doesn't like me. Din, din, din, din, din. Din, din, din, din. He unfollowed me on Twitter. I guess he actually doesn't like me. Nick Merks responds. Uh oh, here we go. I have beef with Huskers. He's like 5'7", buck 80. A high school geometry teacher. How sick was geometry though? Like if you really, if you kind of go back in time. I wish I took geometry way more serious. You know, the little pencil and you make perfect circles but then there's formulas. I mean, that's some cool shit, man. Nick has beef with me because an attorney that was five months ago, they tried to take hosts for the second map when they hosted the first map. We played the first game. Remember what happened? I'll never forget it. Remember that fucking hacker was chasing us around in the car? So I was like, you should just let Swag host this next one because I've noticed when we play with keyboard mouse players, we get a lot more hackers. They're like, you're on PC. If you host, there's a higher chance there's gonna be hackers. And we're like, fuck you, we're taking hosts. And so he was a fucking man baby and cried about it. But he didn't respond to me. You know, I thought that was just poor play. I would say that to his face. Bring him in my Discord. He's a fucking fruitcake. And this whole talking like, yo, I'll say it to his face shit, him and everybody else should just be a little bit careful about that. Yeah, follow me on Twitter. I don't know about those players. We get a lot more hackers. Yeah, this is T-Town. I'm also playing with Tim and Clocky. I was watching a Nick Merc's video. Like when I played with Swag and J Smoothes. Yeah, something about, I don't know, some beef. Yeah, both of them are like five foot eight though. So it's kind of fun to watch. Well, send it over, send over the contract. We'll take a look. I'll have the team take a look too. Yeah, all right. Of course there's not! Grab your popcorn, grab your Mountain Dew game fuel. Get to your seat. Every single seat, Champions Club. It's a front row ticket. Minimal! Minimum! Push in mid. In the middle of the store. Got one down. Two down. See ya. I'm coming, I'm coming. MRAAAA! My control is disconnected. Attack. He's down. That hits tough. Out in the open field. Gas, in front of me! He's right behind me. He's right behind me. Park, park. That's a sniper. Oh my God. All right. Hey, when it starts dripping, it starts pouring. You're absolutely right. Oh man, this guy's dead. See ya. Look at that thing. Look at that. Dude, what the hell? Goon 2020, thank you for the five and super chat. Hey Doc, new season, bring in zombies. I think one year anniversary is gonna be a nuke event for dance, Doc. Time to learn your freedom, soldier. Sure. I'm getting out here. See ya. Happens that fast. That was it. Is this for back to back, Z? Uh, it's for back to back, Doc. Ho ho ho ho ho ho. Uh, wouldn't mind starting to streak. Yeah, I see him right here. Right here. See ya. That guy's melted. You gotta come out. They're both trapped. Get up. Get up. Get on up. Ladies and gentlemen, the M16, it started getting tweaked in, dialed in, calibrated, if you will. Z, the two times side by side, we're dripping in heat and we've barely even begun sprinting. We're going for three wins in a row. I don't want to argue about nothing. Hit one on the right. Got him. Be honest, be honest, be honest. Fuck! Childish, man. This game's almost over for three in a row, Z. Let's get it, baby. I got a guy over here too. Love that, Doc. I have no visual on you. I can't see him. Beautiful shot, Doc. There you go, one. One on the bridge. Bridge, bridge, bridge. Easy. I gotta see this kill cam here. Dripping in heat! In heat! That's three in a row, baby! One shot. Oh, man! I know, man. Hey, you're playing lights out. All right, all right, all right. Hear me? Got one down. Oh my God, oh my! Behind me, behind me. We knew he was, I knew someone was gonna do that. Ladies and gentlemen, we're on board Z-laner. Things are getting heated, explosions everywhere. He's gotta rotate out, and this guy is just waiting. ADS right behind him as if, well, I won't go there, but Champions Club Z still able to potentially get up off the ground. Shot's being over to his right. He's got plenty of gas masks. And guess what? There's four other players left alive. Can Z get the job done? And just like that, ladies and gentlemen, there's two more left on the game. Boom, M60 comes out, boom, blue shielded. And just, woo! And just like that, baby! It's that simple, huh, Doc? Oh! Oh! Holy shit, Z! Man, man. You're such a show off, man. You let me die on purpose by the team that you basically coordinated this attack on me from behind, and then you destroy them, destroy two other guys. You go down for dramatic purposes in the gas with your gas mask, and then you came back alive from that. I mean, Z, that's, you're showing off, man. I just want people to be on the edge of their seats, huh? That's all I want! Good game, Doc, good game, Z. That's amazing, that's amazing. I hope you guys can hear me. Nah. Yeah, no, it is, it is, it is, Colorblind, it is! Hey, Doc! Let's go! Oh, champs, man, that's four in a row! Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I can't wait, I can't wait. I can't wait to get Doc and Z this game. I've been waiting my whole life to get on a mouse and keyboard and look at my monitor, my fourth. It's gonna be so fun. I'm gonna stop their streak. I'm gonna stop their streak.
