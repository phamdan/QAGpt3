Kenny, that's me. That'd be Merrick Chan. No, no, no. Ernie, he's talking about me. Kenny's not talking about him. No, I'm talking about the guy way in the back with the mustache. Yeah, hey, that's me, Kenny. Anybody? Yeah, who's that way in the back with the mustache? It's me. I cannot even tell. There's probably a reason that Alex put him in there. Alex? Wait a minute, Alex. Wait, hold on. Hold on. You been doing a little side hustle? No, no, no. Hold on. What's the issue? What's the issue? Am I not paying you enough, Alex? Huh? You're the best, Doc! I did it. I did it.

What a fun age, huh, Colt? Baby Assassin's starting to get into volleyball a little bit. And she's really liking it. We played volleyball the other night. It was like almost dark. And she comes up to the two-time. I want to play some volleyball. I'm like... I mean, I can't even see anything in Warzone. You expect me to see volleyball at night? Woo! Sure enough, we went outside, played volleyball. Did she win? No. Come on. Alright! Let's go! Hospital? Hospital? Yeah, yeah. Somebody here. Nobody here. Nobody. They're below us. In the temporary building. I found one over here, though. Is this guy underneath me? Is this guy dead? Dead shell. We've got gas moving in. Is there any more? I feel like there's another one, but... Yeah, right here. I knew it. The game sense is pretty strong today. Pretty insane, huh? We're over on the bye, though. Yep, up top here. A couple of them over there. I think they did as well. I'm popping a daddy. I'm popping a daddy, though. One more on me. Last one on me. Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad. Nice. You got a trophy in pocket, huh? I actually got one in here as well.

Downtown is insane right now. Insane. I'm going. I'm gonna get this bounty deal. Go for it. What is this guy doing? He jumped off. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That guy's one shot dead. Dead. We're up top. There was like a whole other team on top of this parking garage. And then there was like two more on that other team that jumped off. He's hitting the zip. Bad choice. Dead, dead. That's amazing. You can't kill me. Contact, contact. I downed him right there by the... Heal him up for me. Thank you. Smoked. I'm gonna get you. Nice. These guys are on the bind. Yeah, yeah. The guy right here too.

You're gonna take that away from me, honestly. I mean, I'm just helping you out. I'm just helping you out. Oh my god. This guy got so fucking lucky. I'm just gonna go right in and wrap around left. Yeah, they're actually more like right over there. Yeah, they're probably moved. They could have even moved up to this building by now, because it's closer to the end zone. Yeah, right in front of us. Oh, yeah, multiple. This guy's right here. And they will. Holy shit. Yeah, sniper on top three. Dead, dead. We're looking for two guys. Looking for two. On me.
