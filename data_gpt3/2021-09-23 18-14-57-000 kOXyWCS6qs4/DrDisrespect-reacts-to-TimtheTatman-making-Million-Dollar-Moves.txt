 Hey listen, apparently they own, uh, the owner of Complexity owns, uh, the Dallas Cowboys as well, or they're heavily involved. Yep. I can buy Complexity right now! Zee? About to be Tim's boss? Yes! You can be Tim's boss! Do it. Let's go win a game, now that Tim's not here we're gonna win, easily. Imagine how pissed he's gonna be. I'm about to hunt these guys down. Drop the trophy on the cart. There it is, they need to catch the ball. Uh, guys down low here, Doc. Not one of them. Easy, uh, it's simple. Hey, not detaching! Easy. It's an easy win! Look at that. What did I tell you? Tim is gone for one game and, well, I don't want to celebrate too early here, but come on now. It's looking pretty nice. So UAV. Hold them down outside. I don't see him yet. Probably right behind the rocks, um, yeah, he was there. We're looking for one guy. We're about to be done, Tim. Yeah, one guy left. So I leave, you guys win, is that how this goes? Yes, that's how it's done. GG, dude. There it is. Go! Let's go, baby! That's how you win! Is that like a good game? Good win, yeah. 29, 10, 14, not too shabby. It felt like an organic game, you know? We didn't have little groupies screaming and yelling in proximity chat, handing us over 25,000, flying all the helicopters. Alright! Tell these guys to stop, Timmy. Yeah, that'll work. Hey Tim, congrats, baby. He deafened, he doesn't care. Okay, fuck, fuck, yeah, fuck me. He's too big time for you now, so he's time for complexity. Every time he's not talking, he's just going to deafen from now on. He's not listening to any of them. Too busy doing org stuff, you know? That's what happens when you do org stuff. There you go. I didn't get any messaging. I think it was because we were... You killed them all, though, right? We're good? Yeah, they're dead, they're dead. Oh, you switched the client tag already, too. What's up, baby? Don't tell me that's in the details of the contract, Timmy. I'll do it. You gotta have it on. Just supporting the org that I am a part owner of, Doc. That's all, man. True. Someone in my chat just said, Doc is sexy. Oh, okay. He's a good looking guy. That's a million dollar smile right there. I kind of got... I got that body underneath a couple layers of fat, if you think about it. I'm thinking about it. You're thinking about my body? You win, Michael. Meet2Small, welcome to the Champions Club. Layer Cake, thank you for the 314. Have you ever had a dream that you... You could... You want... You could do so... You'll do... You want them to do you so much so you could do anything? Yes. That was last night. Have you ever had a dream that... That you had... You... You could... You want... You could do so... You... You want them to do you so much so you could do anything? That was last night. What do I have in my little snack... My little snack drawer in the command center? Whoa, Vanguard! So it might take about, you know, two hours to go through all my key bindings, but I'll let you know. I think I finally got my settings dialed in. I don't even know where anyone is in this map. I assume there's spawn terminal flukey in this game mode. Okay, Z, it's time to turn up! Turn me up! Turn me up, Z! Turn me up! Line them up! Line them up! Oh my! No! No! Attack dog's coming in. No! What the fuck is this? Can't even see this guy crouch in the corner! How do I lose that? Ah, fuck, man. I can't go any faster than that. Someone had like four of them. At some point, I'm going to switch to the snipe and go for clips. It's going to happen. Ray Charles behind you! I didn't mess with any of this. Here we go. Are we talking about the two-time? The two-time? The two-time? I'm not going to disrespect it. What's your choice? Ray! That's him! That's him! That's the two-time champion. Oh, man, you're talking about the two-time back-to-back 1993-94, man. Hey, check this out, bro! Okay, let me know. That's my boy, isn't it? That's my dude. Thomas Griffin, they give you the 20... Look, Doc, I forgot about your frames. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you go through quality yet? Quality, let's do it. Texture resolution, low. Texture filter, low. Particle quality, low, low, off, low, low, low, low, low. I got a couple art directors in the Champions Club. They've already left. Shadow map resolution, low, low, off, off, off, off, low, low. I got everything basically low, Doc, low, off. Do I remove the graphics card from the PC, too? Or is that... Yeah, yeah, get that out of there. Got it. Don't worry, that red barrel right next to you won't blow up. Hey, Carl, you have an order, eh? Hey, you shut your mouth! Turn left, turn left, baby. GG's, Doc. GG's, Doc! Ayyyyyyyyy! Tell that pussy Zoddy ain't nothing, never will be. Zoddy, you ain't nothing, pussy-ass bitch! We're not gonna boost it! Lupa would try Hunt Showdown. He's had, he's... I guarantee Lupa has played Hunt Showdown. If he hasn't played Hunt Showdown, he definitely would like it. Cause he likes Escape from Tarkov. I guarantee he would like that game. Of course, he liked playing Fortnite, so I guarantee he'll like playing any game. Ha ha ha ha! I'm not gonna play it. I'm not gonna play it. I'm not gonna play it. I'm not gonna play it. I'm not gonna play it. I'm not gonna play it. I'm not gonna play it. You just fell down. Yeah, our bottom players, we can't do anything. This has got to be a play to win. Oh! Watch out now! Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Wow! And another one inside, baby. Wow. Wow. See, you kept on talking about your play of the game and I decided to take the real quiet route. See, here's the thing, Doc. Yeah, this game sometimes, it has issues. You know what I mean? It has bugs, it has issues, and that has to be a bug right there because I'm gonna be putting the real play of the game on Twitter, all right?adorezo
