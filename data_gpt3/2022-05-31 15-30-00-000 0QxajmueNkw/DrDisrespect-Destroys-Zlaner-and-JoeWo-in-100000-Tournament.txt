 I am, like you, fascinated by the state of today's online gaming community. AAA game development has hit a stalemate, stream snipers have gotten worse, and online gamers resort to silly antics to keep viewers interested. But there is one man who can change it all. One man with a mission to turn the industry on its head. And he will never succumb to today's algorithmic status quo. I'm yeah. Hey guys, I'm you- Hey guys, I'm Dr Disrespect. Welcome to my YouTube channel. If you like this video, please like it. And if you really like my channel, please subscribe by pressing the subscribe button. If you don't know where the subscribe button is, get the fuck out of my face. Should I redo that? You think that's too- You're okay with that one? Alright. Oh, the mountains. The colorful mountains inside the Unreal Engine in Fortnite. They're the most colorful mountains that I've ever seen. It's gonna be one hell of a grind today to get to the tippity top. But when there's a hundred thousand dollars on the line, and I have a lot of mortgages to pay spread out across the multiple la casas, I want to win. First round, Trick 2G, Horsea. Game one. Let's begin. I got my spot too. They're both dead. That's the end of game one, huh? I think we move on to the next round. He's coming to you. I got him. Got him. Got him. Ah, come on, baby. Alright, that's the end of first round. Let's spectate Doc's game out. We might be going up against Doc and D-Wolf. Oh. Loudly. Loudly. He's about to get- Oh, fucking God. That guy's one shot behind the tree. Don't even try. Don't even try. Holy smokes, man. D-Wolf's gonna drop like a 25 this game or something. Wow. I just break my feet off? Yeah, you did, baby. 25, man. Isn't it crazy that D-Wolf is playing with Doc and D-Wolf was my OG duo partner as well? I wonder if Doc even knows that, man. That's like, this is some deep levels to this story. I love it. Doc talking about the damage again, man. Two to five. Doc's stream is in 1440. Yeah. That's nice. Man, look at his hair glistening. Damn, I'm looking good. The black steel. What did he just say? Don't get all Z-laner on me, you know? Like, you get a little isolated. I don't know. What did he say? Said something about Z-laner getting too isolated. He said, don't go all Z-laner on me right now. I don't even know what he's talking about. Oh my God. I don't even know what he's talking about. Don't get all Z-laner on me, get all isolated. He's just trying to get in our head. He's trying to get in our head before this matchup. Not going to happen, Doc. He's got him one shot. Oh my God. There's no way. They're up by one. They could lose this. They're not even tied. Oh my God, they lost. Dude, they literally just had to sit back. Oh my God. Oh no. Oh my God. Oh my God. Maybe it's meant to happen. I see Doc's chat too. Z's laughing now. Oh yes. Oh yes I am. You make a comment like that, Doc. Against the Z-Z-laner. Against the Z-laner. Not today, buddy. Not today, Stone. I have no heals, man. I think I'm dead. I killed a boar. I don't know if I can throw you the food from here. It would be huge if you can. I don't mark it when you throw it and I'll try to grab it. I threw it over. I saw the head there. Oh my God. I think I'm going to get it. Oh my God. It's so close. It's so close. I didn't get it. I didn't get it in time. Stay with them, baby. Stay with them, baby. Oh my fault. It's multiple. I can't challenge it without the help. The wolf is taking all the damage. You're actually somehow not taking any. You got a team behind me. Yeah, we got players. Oh, baby. No. What? No way. No. They're going to clean the rest of this too. Got one. Stone's down. No. Oh, look at that team over there. That's who got me. Oh, look at him. He just knocked three. Oh man. Yeah, that's game. GG. GG's Z. GG chat. GG. We are out, man.

I mean, that's what else can you ask for other than one hundred thousand dollars in the back pocket? But, you know, it is what it is. So it's going to be another one. Oh, yeah, it's going to be another time to pop off and do your thing. And yeah, but I think you thank you so much for this opportunity. Dee, I hope you're the man expectations. I hope I exceeded and you're the man. I love it. I'm going to take this momentum. I'm fucking I'm a run with it and don't stop sprinting either. Even if you get a little tired. Yeah, even if you get a little tired, I know I got too much energy for that. Hell, yeah. We're going to observe what's going on here. Welcome back, everybody, to the hundred thousand dollar hot shot duo drop feature. Yeah, I like the energy. Flex is double joined by goes. We see an unfortunate and untimely ending for the two time champions. No, I'm being in my heart nonetheless. Thank you. You got some score updates for us. Yeah, I believe they did fall actually tied fifth in six together. So as we take a look at that bracket, disrespect Andy Wolf will still be walking away with five thousand dollars. Five thousand dollars, baby. Come on, man. Someone farted in the locker room at the arena. Can I get a Febreze Navi that I. Holy shit. We're kidding, huh? Hey, champs. Appreciate all the commitments today and all week long, and you've done a pretty good job of keeping the place nice and clean. I only expect the best from each and every single one of you. So let's make sure. We keep it clean day after day. I don't know where I was going with that point. I mean, who am I? When I take a shit, I. Whether I wash my hands or not, I mean, it doesn't matter. Anyways, I I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. If it's it's almost like whoever farted. It's. It's like some sort of chemical imbalance or something. Oh, God. Oh.
