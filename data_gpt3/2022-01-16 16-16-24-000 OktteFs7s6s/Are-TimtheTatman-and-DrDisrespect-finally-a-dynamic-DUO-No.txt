Alright, enough Captain's shit. Let's just do it, okay? YEEEAAAAH! Alright, come on baby! Let's go! Ooh, I might go 10. I might go 10. I'm going. I'm getting real cocky at 10. Did you hear what they just fucking vanish? I went into these tents, Doc. Are you underground right now? Yeah, I'm underneath. I'm trying to get through, bro, but I went tents, so... Can't even see him. Yeah. Coming down. Got a guy right in front of me. I don't know where he's at. He's flying at me. Right here. On my ping. There you go. Easy. I mean, it took you like what? Homie, I... I'm not trying to get into an argument with you. You said tents, I went tents. You went under the fucking cave. I'm not... Oh, you can play in if you can. Play in. You can kill this guy. One shot up there. He's one shot. I threw a god throwing knife at my kill. I'm going up the ladder right now. Play in if you can. I'm up here with you. He just dropped down. I'm up. I'm up. I got two broke above you, bro. I'm going. Got him. Beautiful, Timmy. Another guy. Get off the bridge. Get off the bridge. So I can fucking eliminate him. These guys were not together. Beautiful. Wait, under me? In front of me. He's coming up right here. Just called that cluster. I'm on it. Got him right behind him. I just accidentally jumped down. One shot on the bridge. He's one shot on the bridge. I'm coming right now. Okay. The guy marked flew into the by. There's literally staircases that don't work. Yeah, don't get me going. They're getting ripped from right there. Almost here. Got one. Okay, they killed the kid on the by. Wait, self-dime, he died. Oh my god. Another team was in that hut. I see him. One shot on the wood logs right in front of the place. On my right. They ran on me. I'm dead. Come on. I got one. Oh, I see him. I got the kid that was just shooting you. But on the rock? No, on my life. My life is gone. He's right here. Oh my. See ya. Timmy, I need you to wake up, baby. I want to go to these guys. There's a lot of people outside of the zone. I got to isolate this guy on the right side. I downed him. Beautiful. Last guy. Don't worry. Beautiful. I'm going to run back into the zone. You're an idiot. Guys to our left. 199. 199. Guys farther down. I have to back up, Timmy. I have to back up. I have to, man. I'm one shot. Right here, Doc. Right there on my life. Huge. Nice. That's it. Beautiful. Guys, one shot on that hill. Climb out of there. Oh, he's one shot. Literally. He's going to your side. He's going to your side. Brother. Another team down here. Another team down here. Oh, shit. Jesus. I'm going to use you as bait a little bit. I'm out of this cluster. I'm stunned. I probably think you're stunned. That's actually huge. I'm clustering first. I hear coughing behind you. Yep. Stick. Stick. Stick. Do you have a gas mask? I don't. One shot on that tree. There you go, babe. Come on, baby. Come on, Timmy. Come on, Timmy. Come on, Timmy. Come on, Timmy. That's exactly what the 49ers are going to be doing to the Cowboys. So stupid. They're going to give them a chance. They're farther down. Yeah, I feel like our height is... Right over here. I think he's rising right now. I'm full centered for it. Okay, I'm going to flash over. Flashed him. Beautiful. Beautiful. I spotted some movement up here. I'm going to bait him this way. I'm not with you. I hear him right behind me. I'm trying to fly now. Go, Doc! Jesus. One at a time, baby. One at a time! Stuck on rocks again. Story of my life. Right here. Getting shot at. They went low. They went low. I'm dead. I committed to it. Stupid of me. I'm getting clustered. I'm wrapping up behind. I have to hurry up. I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. I didn't mean to fucking jump down right there. There's two people on my ping. On my live. Oh wait, this last two. Keep them busy. Keep them busy. I am. I have a cluster as well. Both down. I got one full. Good job, Doc. Come on, Timmy! We don't need Z. All of y'all tried to say over and over and over again y'all need Z. You guys need Z later. This is just a show that we don't. Doc and I can get duo wins. We can get duo trio wins. Just fine. We don't need Z. Not a bad game, either, Timmy. You tried to keep up with the two-time and I respect it. Oh, shut the fuck up, bro. You're not kill checking me on the one win we got today right. And I'm one off you? No fucking way. I'm not kill checking you. I'm damage checking you. How do we take that? Where you going? I got a guy knocked. I am telling you, move with me. Let's back up. Let's move with me. I knocked a guy. No, we're not. There's a difference between getting pinched and being in control of the situation. Holy shit! I haven't seen you shoot your fucking weapon in like 15 minutes. Alright, alright. I am objectively going to let you know, Azure Timmy, I think that is a bad push. No, no, no. What's with me, Timmy? No, I'm not. I'm doing a rotation. I am not sprinting directly to it. Boom, I won my fight. Where's my backup? Precision airstrike. Timmy, rotate with me. Oh my god, man. Is it? It's me. Fuck, man. If you're there with me, Timmy, that's an easy 1v3, or 2v3. I can't believe you, man. I gotta go outside. I'm taking a break. I'm in. Yeah, you're gonna come back. Did you come? What's that, Timmy? Sorry. You're back? There's a team down here by the tents, though. I'm flying up here just because I hear him and I'm hungry. He's what's new. Seaner, thank you for the Kanata 6.99. Hey Doc, did you know that Vanguard multiplayer has Ninja as a perk, Dead Silence as a field upgrade, and a gun perk that gives you Dead Silence?
