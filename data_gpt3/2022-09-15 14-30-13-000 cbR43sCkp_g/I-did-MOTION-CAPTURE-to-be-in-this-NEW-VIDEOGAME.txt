 to be an NBA 2k23, the basketball game. And we're in it. How sick is this? Ladies and gentlemen, I'm telling you right now, I'm going to get loaded in an NBA 2k23. There might be some technical issues. I hooked up the PlayStation 5 on this brand new. On this brand new audio setup. My career, let me skip all this. All right, Kendrick. Hold on. Let me skip it. Just real quick. Boom. Whoa! Hey, how are you guys? There he is. Yeah. Appearance, here we are. Oh, we have the Showtime vest in black, too. Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's get that boom. Oh, we know. Oh, yeah. Camouflage joggers. There they are. Face, prototype scopes. Oh, man. How sick is this? Like, you guys are probably going like, Jesus, Doc. Settle down. Like, no, I'm really good looking. There he is. Hey, there he is, man. Maybe maybe he rides. I could see Doc riding a go-kart around, actually. Hell yeah. Michael Jordan go-kart. Absolutely. Yeah. Hey, there he is. Hey. Hey. I know we did some motion capture for like Jump Shot and a couple celebrations. I don't know if they're in though. I got to tell you about the whole motion capture experience. I got in one of those suits. You know, the one that they have, like Devin Booker was in, where they record all the animations for their, like, prominent superstars and all that stuff. Yeah, two big, huge, massive motion capture arenas. There he is. There he is, man. Let's go run some game here. Can we go join the beast? Beast of the East? Oh, I like that. Set quest waypoint. Oh, what are we playing on Caldera? I didn't know Warzone and 2K were collaborating. I miss the days of going to the park and like knowing that you hit it just right, where it's packed and you've already got like, hey, you need one? Okay. We're two games out? Okay, cool. And it's just a big day. It's early Saturday morning. That was every single Saturday from seventh grade all the way through high school. I see. Hey, how are you? Good. I'm doing good. Because here's the thing, and if you don't mind, I'm shredded. I'm ripped. I am an overall 99. I've got all the badges. Are you listening? Park Dunk Celebration. Here I come to save the day. Hey, hey. You ready to head to the arena? Appreciate y'all, bro. Anytime, man. You know, I wish I could go with you, but... Hey, another day, another dollar, right? You already know. There you go, man. Oh, it was good, man. Not much, man. How are you? I'm good. I'm going to pledge to it tonight, buddy. Guys, I'm going to point. No offense to the rec... Yeah, yeah. Still looking to get... Get him off me. He's too small. He's too small. Back it up. Let's back it up. And MP works his way inside and... You know, with a result like that, we'll see them running again, especially at the decadent past athleticism.... pass to MP. MP with the response. My guy just doesn't want to dunk anything, does he? We've got a minute 48 left. There you go.... back to the Sheff Owens MPB thing I'm going here. Brad, have you ever experienced or seen anything like that? I mean, except for... The LBA done for the Golden Sable League on-set. Game here. And I'm... AK play. He's got the rebound, number five here tonight. Number three is up. Oh! And here's MP from outside. Oh, let's go! Ah! Get that shit out of here! Get that shit out of here! Get that shit out! Ah! Ah!... to increase this league. Finger roll, baby. And the rise of the internet has helped give players their own voice. Boy, oh, boy, are we looking good or what? That was fun. That was so... That was super fun. But I got to be real with you, man. What a fucking trip to be in NBA 2K23, the basketball game, and we're in it. Basketball was my whole life, and it'll always be a part of my life. That is a trip. Fear me out. I think we go here, but let's really take a look at who's landing around us, and then maybe we can make our next decision. I'm actually putting a personalized guarantee we win this game. I'm actually putting a personalized guarantee we win this game. Keep an eye on me. On the roof, on the roof. I'm setting up an aggressive portal. He's one shot, he's one shot!

How far out were they, doc? They're on the 240, like the middle of the compound, left side. Red shield, red shield. They'll probably drop their ramp. Fucking hell, they're not even close. They're portaling, portaling to the left. Team here, team here, team here. Hold the holding, hold the holding. Run, run, run, run, run. Pull back, stop. Yep, solo. 82 on me. I'm not gonna heal, I have to heal, I have to heal. One shot, one shot, one shot, one shot. Swap quick. Swapping, swapping, swapping. These guys are fighting out there, man.

Oh, I'm not with you. Hold on, I'm going to the other side, doc. I'm down the push side, I'm gonna be on the other side. You gotta wait for team on you. I'm gonna go with doc, I'm gonna go with doc. Yep, I'm ramping this way, I'll be there in eight seconds. Knock out of knock, three kill. Still team right here. All the way to the right, all the way to the right. Deep right, Kurt. Yep, yep, I got your full doc. We gonna do a little something here, follow up. Still up, still back here. Yep. We're attacking that. Watch our right. There's a team already on that portal. There's a team. Don't go right, don't drop anything. We might want to go this way. Yes, we can go back and go to those. Sierra's weak as well. 39 up there. Crack one. They're just gonna, we gotta watch our ass, guys. We gotta watch our ass. Yeah, we do, we do. I'm scanning, I'm scanning. Maybe I'm crazy. I got nothing, I got nothing on scan. Yep, yep, they're moving. That guy's low. He's cracked, he's cracked. The nades, there's a throwable. Got some nades on that pillar right there. They're gonna move, hold on. Cracked one. Hit 135. Flush! I'm moving down the hill here, I'm moving. Give me one shot, give me dead. See, you're gonna shot the back, look at the caustic. I know, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing. Give me one shot. Heal, heal, heal. We got one knock, we're good, we're good. Let's take him down here, we got flush. Yep, yep, we got a heal. Oh my god, one hit. 33, gear broken, 12. Oh my god, he's one shot, serious. Cracked one, almost cracked another. Holy crap, oh! One's moving up the right, one's moving up the right. They're in the middle of all the hills, they're right on me right now. One's right on me. Pushing me right now, behind me, behind me. Knocked him, right on you. Cracked one, cracked one. I had to move that cracker. Damn, man. Almost closed, dude. I didn't make a bad play, I just had to instantly kill him. I got hit by, oh my god, look at this, man. How, how? On my way! God damn it!
