Here's f***ing 50 bucks for five pills. Doc doesn't read donos. Yeah, I do. Huge pants, thank you for the three. Hey, Doc, what was the last time you had hot caca coming out of your small bum hole? That's a little personal, don't you think? But by the way, I did have tremendous diarrhea three times this morning. Yo Doc, can you do that Jean-Claude Van Damme dance from Kickboxer? What am I, like some sort of side street puppet? Huh? Doctor, do this, Doctor, do this. Here, here's money. Huh? Lay down, boy. Is that what I am? Dude, play something. Shut your mouth up, Josh! You p***y! Play the game. Hey, why don't you go adjust your new balance shoes, your fat ankles. Shut your mouth. I'll play the game when I get to it. Doc, would you play Final Fantasy 16 when it comes out? Get this guy out of my, get him out of the arena right now. Doc, you need to focus on the wind. You need to focus on your face. Audio is low, Doc. No, your height is low, Arnie. Take your wig off, says Javier Hernandez. Why don't you take your f***ing braces off? You still look ugly. All right, watch your mouth inside of the arena, man. Hey Doc, I have an important job interview on Wednesday. Any advice? Yeah, yeah. Stop wearing suspenders. That doesn't make you look sophisticated. Trust me. Doc, are those your legs or are you riding a chicken? I guarantee my legs are bigger than yours. Unless you're, unless you're just fat. Thank you for the $4.99. Doc, get Timmy Tenders to run some routes for you. Jesus. What am I throwing at him? Chicken McNuggets? Josh Cohen in the chat. Start playing something! Sure. There. Pinoche, thank you for the $4.99. Doc, what's we plus me? Uh, it's weenie. Why you six foot eight with 37 inch vertical leap and squat with Nico, but not me?

How come Joe swear to you, but not me? How come it's him, but not me? Hey Doc, why you bogeying on me? I don't know. What are we trying to make? Doc, how come you're an incredible golf course builder, but not me? Why you tripping in violence at speed of momentum and not temp daddy? How come you had to hook him, but not show you hook him? How come you are a daddy, but not us? Why you root for warriors, but not me? Why you, but not me? Well, because you got inward knees. Looks like your back goes straight through your ass and into your hamstrings. I mean it's flatter than ever. Listen, I don't really want to break your whole body down, but that's why it's me and not you. Doc, why you talk, but not me? Because I don't want to hear your ugly looking mouth. How come you have a process, but not me? How come you one time, but not me? How come you, but not me Doc? Doc how come you midnight society, but not society midnight? Fine, fine it's kinda weird to go society midnight. Why you talk to them, but not me? How come you go, yeah, but nah huh? Doc, how come you the best, but not me? How come you white on white, but not white white on white? Hey Doc why you you so hot, but not me? Doc how come you jawline, but not me? How come you coach him, but not me?

How come you get through your spiciest city diarrhea, but not me? How come you doctor disrespect, but not Dr. Diarrhea? Well, that's probably not a name I want. You know what I mean? Doc, I've been playing Warzone for six months, and I still haven't gotten my first win. Any advice? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. But don't you think, if you're the 499, Doc got my first solo Warzone victory yesterday. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Your, your first? Ha ha ha. Mike Capusta. That's a fake last name, isn't it? Davey Decibel. Jimmy Firecracker. Hey, the name's Jimmy! I see where you got your nickname from. Burrito! When a name Burrito donates five dollars, how can he not yell it out? Burrito! That for me and Dirty Dan, Dookie. Welcome! Shammu! Rhyme! What do your fingers smell like, Doc? Uh, shit. MEC-E $1,000 donation. I mean, we almost... Hey, MEC. Roger that. Another $1,000 donation from MEC-E. And again, no message attached. None. Firm handshakes to you, MEC. That's just way too much money. You know that. I don't even know what you want me to do. Like, you want me to do a burnout on my way out of the arena? Hey, Doc, how come you got 1K but not me? Said Chip Green. I don't got 1K, I got 2K now. You see what I'm saying? All right, that's enough. MEC-E with another $1,000 donation. I don't know who this guy is. I gotta get off before he donates like 40, 50, 60 thousand dollars. That's way too much. Looking better than Chuck Norris and Delta Force, Doc. This is T-O-O-O-O-O-T-T-0-0. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. You know what? I'm gonna go get some more. Noon donation. Noon donation. Noon donation. Noon O-Ten! Donation! Can we please give him a motivational speech in Dolphin? Vinoche, thank you for the $9.99, Doc. My 13-year-old son Ethan says he can make better dolphin sounds than you. Listen, because he hasn't gone through the puberty state yet, right? His voice is still like this, hey Dad, Dad, you wanna play ball? Sure. Can you lower the rim to seven feet? Once he hits 14, 15, 16, it's, hey Dad, hey Dad, can you put the rim up to eight and a half to nine, nine and a half feet? I mean, of course he's gonna do a better dolphin sound than me. Sandy Hoy, welcome to the Champions Club. Weeksauce, thank you for the three, one doctor's doctor's another doctor does a doctor whose doctor's a doctor doctor the doctor the way the doctor he's doctoring doctors. Yes, you read my mind. Adam, thank you for the 10 in Super Chatty Doc. My dad passed away in October and then my house burned down in February. Myself, wife, and kids made it out okay. Your streams have definitely helped me through this time. You are the goat. Start my morning watching the goat. Call me a goat. Roo, thank you for the 499. You see a goat every morning when you look in the mirror, Doc. I saw some goats this weekend. We'll trip to a park and some goats, little petting goats. I tried talking to them. They wouldn't talk back to me. They looked at me with their eyes, you know, and their eyes are like, like they're like this. And they're staring at me like. Hey Doc, why do ducks have feathers? To hide their butt quacks. Thank you Smoking Pixel for the five months. Oh, hey, it's AK with the 699. Didn't get to meet you on Friday, but really expected the way you look. I really respected the way you took the time to talk to each person. You shook your hand. See you next time. Doc says, oh, hey, it's AK with the 699. I'm not going to shake their hand and not say anything to them. I joined months ago. Here's fucking 50 bucks for black news. This is Aaron Burnett with the 4999. Man the energy and the excitement from you. I need every single one of these champions club members to be on that same level on this Monday to set the tone for the rest of the week.
