 Hey guys, Dr. Disrespect today, I'm spectating the $100,000 World Series of Warzone Tournament solo banger! Please like the video, subscribe to my channel, bro, lowkey, bro. Let's do it. I think the solo tournaments are more fun to watch. Destroy and Z-laner are in it too. Oh man, we gotta, uh... Let's get our broadcaster tools up. Who do we want to watch? Timmy and Z? Timmy's so terrible at this game, isn't it? Isn't it funny how bad someone can be with as much time spent playing the game every single day? 100 and what's the bet? What place do you think he's going to get? Bro, bro, 106 placement. That's what I said. You mean odds of me falling my death, bro? Y'a ass. Oh, he's going straight peek. I think we kind of have to go on board here. Oh, that's a Crowder. Goodnight. Oh shit, Timmy's done. God, you weren't even close, Timmy. We're going to watch... We're going to turn it over to Timmy's gulag. We're going to watch it. We're going to watch it. Goodnight, Timmy. Goodnight. What'd he get? 111! I don't know who this is, man. Alright, well I'm dead. Alright, let's get back. Let's get on board. Come on, Z. You see him? Wow, I've never seen someone hit that so quick. Guy below? Right below? Holy shit. Goodnight. Careful, careful. Go get your eyes on him. Another guy coming up that zip. There he is. There he is. There he is. I don't like this guy looking over to your left. That's what's about to happen. Yeah. I called it, though. I called it. Remember champs, I called it. I called it. That's the same dude that he was chasing before. Fuck, man. And he's going to say it in three, two... I thought I had some sex. That's the dude that I did not want you to... I didn't want you to expose yourself to this guy. Holy shit! Perfect shots, Tommy. Wow. Hey, I told you, I'm not fucking around. I don't give a shit. I'm playing this like a normal game. I'm pushing. I'm pushing everybody. I really don't care if it gets me killed. I'm not sitting in one spot. What kind of mentality is that, Z? Let's wake up! Win this thing! Win this thing! GG. That's it. That crouch is insane. I couldn't even see him. I couldn't even fucking see the guy. Nice drop shot. Did we go and watch the defending champion? There's two more narratives I can attach myself to, champs. Two more narratives. I feel like I got to try to work my way up the mines or something. The first is Scum going back to back. That's the next one. After this, we'll check in on Aiden and then maybe Huskers. Those are a couple that I want to watch. Clear. I think Huskers, I mean, he's a primetime player. We've got a couple options, which is good. This dude right here, man. The Riot Shield Reaper back at it again. Yeah. Hey, get him, Scum! I like how he's doing it from the Optica headquarters, too. He's not at home doing this. He showed up to work today. He brought the green Optic gaming apparel as the champion from last year. Looking, and trust me, I can relate. Looking to go back to back. I got to tell you a story about Scum and the Optic gaming team called Duty Team. So we went to that Dallas Mavericks game. Shout out, Hex. We stopped by the Optic headquarters and got up with some people, shook hands. But the team was, I think, either scrimmaging or I think, I don't even think they were scrimmaging, I think they were actually playing one of their league games, right? So I got to sit there and watch a little bit of it, witness it firsthand. It's kind of nice, man. You talk about backstage VIP. Anyways, I think they just lost or they're in between games. They go use the restroom, they come back and I'm standing in the hallway with Hex. And boom, right in the front, Scum. Doesn't even make eye contact. Walks right by the whole team. They get serious when they're playing. They don't want to talk to anybody. They don't want to dab anybody. They don't want to. It's all about the game. I told Scum, if he wins, if he gets a nuke within the next three games, I'll send him a signed vest, framed, everything. And you guys see the pictures of these. I mean, it's, you know, we're not talking cheap here. What's he do? First game, gets a nuke. So we sent him the vest. I actually think I'm just going to drive around. But what I'm going to say right now, this is a one of one right here. Scum, one of one right here. I got a card, trophy, sure. One of one. And I'm getting Discord messages, sure. You win this game, it's yours. Signed, framed. That's yours OG. I'm dead. I feel like it's in good... Look at what he's surrounded. Who the fuck just shot at me? I don't know. Oh my God, how am I still alive? He's done the impossible. He needs to find a house or something, man. He's scaring the shit out of me. This is almost giving me high anxiety. I'm like, I can't believe the anxiety that I am starting to like build up inside of me watching this. Oh no. Oh no. What the... Get off the main roads and get into storage. Number one. Okay. Oh my. It's kind of big. You're in. Now this is your arena. This is your pit. This is your arena. Oh my God, that's a person. No. Holy shit. There was another guy on the other wall. That's it. Oh, there was another guy on that wall. Fuck, man. But I'm telling you, it's not easy going back to back. It isn't. How's Aiden doing? Aiden wants it. He wants to win. Oh, that second one didn't hit. No. GGs. Is that fucking Reese, bro? No fucking way. Is Huskers in it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. No. GGs. Is that fucking Reese, bro? No fucking way. Is Huskers in it? Let's bring him out. He talks like this. Huskers. Hey guys. Huskers. I'm telling you, man. This dude knows how to win. Oh, he's in the gas. He's going to be low coming out of there. Oh my god. Dead silent? Don't tell me he comes down to dead silence. Where's the audio? Yeah, where is the audio? Oh, bro. I didn't hear shit. Didn't hear anything either. Oh my god. There's no way this dude just sprinted to his fucking shack with no footsteps. How does Huskers not go nuts right there, man? Here's partially the problem with the community right now. I'm just not feeling enough passion about the problems with the game and hopefully they look at these and correct them. I'm not seeing enough passion. People are like, yeah, that's fine. I didn't hear the guy. That's fine. Like what? Alright, who's next? I'm running out of options. Swag? Oh, he's still in it. Okay. Okay, Swag. Dang, his audio is low, huh? Big one. That's a big one. Oh, that stun. No. Come on, baby! 1v1v1v1v1! Ooh, let him go, let him go, let him go, let him go, let him go. Yep. Oh! How did I lose? Oh, man. How did I lose? Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. No! No! How did I lose? Oh, no, no. No! Oh, holy shit. No! Man, you're close, Swag. Man, top three. Dot curse? Let's not talk about some sort of made up belief of a dot curse, okay? No! We're not gonna clip it all together and make some montage and then call it the dot curse. Today, I'm spectating World Series of Warzone Tournament. Who do we want to watch? Timmy and Z? Bro, 106 placement. Okay, Timmy's done. Goodnight, Timmy. Oh, goodnight. 111! That's the dude that I did not want you to do. I didn't want you to expose yourself to this guy. Can we go and watch the defending champions? This is your pit, this is your arena. Oh my god, it's a person. No! Holy shit. There's another guy on the other wall. That's it. How's Aiden doing? That second one didn't hit. No! GG. His Husker's in it. Oh my god. Dead silence? Don't tell me he comes down to dead silence. Alright, who's next? I'm running out of options. Swag? Oh, he's still in it. Okay. 1v1v1v1v1. Let him go, let him go, let him go, let him go, let him go. Oh! How did I lose? I had to remind Tim on Twitter, dog. You see my tweet? I had to remind Timmy. 38 out of 40? That's the final scoring, yeah. That's what place he got? Is that for the teams? That's for the teams, yeah. 38 out of 40. Holy shit.
