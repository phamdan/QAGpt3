 You hear the lightning? You hear the rain? The thunder? Do you feel the dark alleyways? Do you feel the smog and the smoke in your lungs? Do you feel like you need to survive? That's good. Then you arrived in the right spot. The arena. Violence. Speed! And a whole bunch of momentum. Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get out! Get him out! Get him out of here! Who wants to fly on a sublime? I do! You arrived at the gym. You get on the treadmill and you sprint as fast as you can. And while you're sprinting, you start to feel the line on that treadmill. You start to feel the rhythm. And that's when you close your eyes while you sprint. Once you close your eyes on your face, that's when you break your leg. Once you break your leg, you get back up. You get on the bike and you start pedaling as fast as you can. Until your lower back starts spasming out. Now you got a broken leg, a precious skinny lower back, and the will to meet the two-time on the basketball court for a little 1v1 session. It's up to you. Let's get buckled in. Yeah! Got a guy right above me. Come on! Give me your life. Give me your life. My birthday was Wednesday and the best part is I have my... Can you turn down the fucking music, Alex? I can't... I can't even hear myself! Ladies and gentlemen, Courage and Vic Star. One, two, three. Uno, dos, tres. Boom! Boom! Boom! Easy, easy. Get him out of here. Get him out of here. Boom! Boom! Boom! God, I got to scream boom every time. I'm sorry, but it just feels good. Is that content? Sitting here, opening packs, me reacting to three little boxes and looking for a particular object. Or do we go into a house, fucking look a guy in his face, say you got no chance, demolish him, knock him down, reload the weapon, swap shields, go outdoors, vertical climb to the top of the building, look down at a second partner of his team, thrash his face once again. Boom, knock his ass down. Now it's a 1v1 situation to win the game. Like you tell me, you want me to open up a couple fucking apex packs? Wrong. Come on! Let's go! Nice. Nice. First game on, gentlemen! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Beautiful, beautiful, baby. I'm watching it in the last game. Love to see it. Woo! One right here, last one. I got knocked too. He's resing his buddy. Right on his corner. His buddy got resed? Yep, yep, yep, yep. Right here? On me, on me. Whoa, let's go, Stalling! Not today, my friend. Not today, baby! Here comes our desperation. Fucking desperation. You got your fucking goggles on, huh? You got your fourth monitor? You pussy! Why don't you go get a fucking job? Yo Vic, how old are you again? I'm 26, just. Ah damn, a little bit too old. I wanted to see if our ages added up together. We're still younger than Docs. Mmm. Give him the love tonight. Good afternoon. Alex, remove the VOD. I can't have this guy. No, no, no. I can't have him showing me, showing the two time up like this. I can't. Well, get rid of the VOD. Here's the thing I'll say about Warzone, right? They did a fantastic job in creating something and having a lot of energy around it for the past year and a half, right? Obviously, outside of the anti-cheat stuff, it was a good run. I think where things are at now is a combination of a few things. First off, fatigue with the map, okay? These little minute changes that happen with each season, just not enough. Or maybe it was enough. I guess it was enough. But I think we're at the point where we've maxed that out. So, brand new map, you shelf this one, get it out of the list, right? Number two, obviously, the anti-cheat stuff, hackers, etc. Third party, they need to come in, they need to make a big investment, make that happen. And then number three, it's the quality of life things. It's the smaller things that aren't talked about enough that can really greatly improve this game. I mean, good example is the concussion. You know, based off the TTK in the game, to fight some guy who stuns you and now you're stunned for 10 seconds, it just doesn't make sense. You know, it's looking at that, it's prioritizing all those little things. Dead silence in the game, do we want it? Do we even want dead silence? No. Don't even make them rare, just get them out of the game. Hit boxes around vehicles and trucks, or make the trucks weaker. I don't know. I still think it's not quite as big of a problem as it used to be, so maybe that's not a bigger issue. But there's just a lot of small quality of life issues that could just be tweaked, looked at, prioritized and tweaked. I mean, we can name them all, right? The gas mask animation, you don't see the first part of the animation for like half a second. It's like, and then he grabs it and puts it on, or and then he grabs it and takes it off. There's like a split second where you're in the animation and you can't do anything, but there's nothing happening on your screen and you don't know that you're in it right then and there. You know what I mean, champs? Like you go to fire your gun, but like nothing was happening, and then he puts the mask on and takes it off. It's very quick, but it's just long enough to be a little pain in the ass, in my opinion. Trey Moore with a $5 donation in Super Chat. Hey Doc, I just took a dump. Oh, that's good. That's, I love reading donations. Doc, what's in the folder? I've already showed you. What do you want me, do you want me to tease another thing? I don't want to tease. I don't want to, I don't want to get it, like, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe I'm, maybe I said, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe I said, maybe I'm looking on something and I'll let you know. Tease us. Let me see. This will be, I just feel like this will be the last sneak peek. You know what one of the biggest draws for me with video games, especially multiplayer, that I get from, I'd say, you know, a battle royale or hell, even like Escape from Tarkov. You know, there's this level of intensity built within the narrative of the competition, of the objective, whatever you want to call it. And I think that's just so important in video games. And I feel like there's not enough doing that, like that are taking it to that next level where like, wow, you just went on this journey and you're on the final sort of conclusion. This shit feels intense. Right. When the time is right champs. We'll jump in that. Not only will we jump in that. We'll really reveal what's inside that folder. But just give me some time. It's so nice to see you happy while playing. It's a stoneward bust. I'm always happy. Just because I scream and yell at a game doesn't mean I'm depressed or something. I mean, granted I mean to your point, it is like, actually you bring up a good point. It's, it really is tough to play video games for living. So I appreciate you sort of understanding that angle. But I'm happy.
