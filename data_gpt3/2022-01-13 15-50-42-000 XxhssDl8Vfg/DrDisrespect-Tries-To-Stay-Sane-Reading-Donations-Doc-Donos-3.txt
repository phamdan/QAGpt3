 Young Darryl, thank you for the three. You look like your skin is smooth as butter. Man, I hate reading donations. Thank you for the $20 donation, Doc. I'm so excited to see the VSM in YouTube. The violence of Doc, speed of Z, momentum and Tim. Wait. Momentum and Tim don't go together. Give him the love, Doc. Looking good, baby. Ah, Tim can get a little momentum, especially if he trips downhill. D-Money, money, thank you for the $5 Super Chat donation. Doc, check your headset. Everything's fine. If the audio for your game is terrible, it don't matter what headset and what condition that headset's in. This shit sounds the exact same. Hey Doc, how do you stay so high energy with this low energy snooze fest of a gaming industry? Says Bear Vincent with the $3 donation, steroids and jacuzzi massages. Oh, Mrs. Assassin. Bro, bro, I set my PR record, bro. Hey, old man. Bro, old man. Meet 2 Small, welcome to the Champions Club. Layer Cake, thank you for the 314. Have you ever had a dream that you... You could... You'll do... You want... You do so... You'll do... You could... You want... And you want them to do you so much so you could do anything? Yes, that was last night. I found Timmy's blankie, but it's got hot cock on it. Should I toss it out? Says Colt of Gozer with a $3 donation, I'd burn it. Be careful, it might be flammable. Hey Doc, I've been dealing with a lot of rejection from other people at work. Any advice from your perspective on how to deal with that? Yes, you've got to stop working with your wife. Go find another job. It's probably best for the relationship. Doc, how come you and not me? Because me I did my hukum you. How come you go ring-a-ding-a-ling but not me? Doc, how come you are you but not me? How come you eat chicken enchilada but not bean? Doc, how come you sexy but not me? Because you have one tooth. Matthew Maka, thank you for the $5 donation. Hey, hello from Australia mate. I'm not even in the game in one bit, mate. I literally just watch you because you're so fucking funny and you're... Listen, first off, Matthew, I mean what's so funny? Plot some music. That's right, I don't have the Alex, I gotta do it myself. What's so funny? Dylan Lai, thank you for the Australia, mate. $100 donation. Ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya, doc. Is that how you do that in Australia? Jesus. That's ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, it's not ya-ya. Doc, how come you at the tippity-top and not me? Says German Suha with a $4.99. You might be out of shape. Simon T, thank you for the 10 in Super Chat. You missed my donation about five hours ago. I've been in the arena seats so long. My ass has gone numb. You should feel my ass. Actually, let me take that back, Simon. Let me just relay the information that my ass is numb too. Doc, I used boost high in my audio. What audio? Enemy dropping into the ARV. Immolators, you melee with your rifle as long as there's not a blade on it or knuckle dusters, which I make......can be salted during treatment, defended by one team, team can be set up, defense other teams, infiltrated, permission rewards. You're welcome. I'm so sleepy. I hope my head doesn't fall into keyboard... Miata, Matt, that's a fake name, but I like it. Thank you for the five in Super Chat. Doc, my son was trying to revive you and was screaming, wake up! Thanks, Wex. Absolutely, Daniel Sorensen with a $100 donation. Remind him, Doc, don't forget to stretch. Oh, I just stretched right now. Stretched my asshole. The Juice Man, thank you for the five in Super Chat. Tidying up this in your tournament to lose, nobody there better be able to want to be kings, but the ace is back. What the... Doc, your nostrils aren't symmetrical, says Max Gobelle. What the... Doc makes blood rush to my head. Not that one, the other one. What the... Hey, Doc, you ever fart so hard that it doesn't itch anymore? No. Dr. Diz's Respex Belly Button is actually a power outlet, says Mark Anthony Ramirez with a five. What the... I was in the locker room lathering myself in Vaseline, but then I got hot diarrhea and got stuck in the toilet. Now every time I try and wiggle my way out, the automatic flush keeps trying to flush my marble bag down the drain. Well, just stay dry, stay dry. Someone's on their way. How about the donkey on the wall? Milk, milk. Doc, you should be able to pick up what you eat to produce the best hot caca. Says Colin Bryant with a $50 Super Chat donation. Now that's getting a little weird. Colin, you're pretty sick in the head. What the fuck? Watching your streams as I grind until I find for another permanent job, have help, thank you two times. Says Chris Kimball with a $5 donation. And it will come. All you gotta do is trust. All you gotta do is trust yourself. It will come out of nowhere. All you gotta do is trust yourself. Owen Bailey, thank you for the $4.99 Super Chat. Hey, Fire Mario, you look like Dr. Disrespect. Fire Mario. I don't know if I like your tone, but I'm gonna look him up. Fire Mario. Hey, Fire Mario, I'm gonna... Son of a bitch. Wow, Doc, you finally washed your black shirt. Quote of the day from Dave Carlson with a $6.90. I'm glad you noticed. I felt like it was about time to give it a wash, huh? Jason Duddington, thank you for the $5. Dr. Disrespect, the Mickey Mouse of streamers. What the fuck is this? Hello, boys and girls. Hello, boys and girls. Oh, no. Minnie Mouse, oh, I love you. Welcome to Disneyland. Hello, boys and girls. Holy shit, Doc, my last name is pronounced Hastings. You're right, says Chris Hastings with a $19.94. Appreciate it. Tristan, hey, Doc, it's my brother Kohan's birthday today. Can I get a yayayayayayayaya for him on his special day, says Tristan Hanson with a $4.99. Hey, yayayayayayayaya. Ah. My apologies. You look like a lean, muscular fire, black mamba, ready to strike its prey, says Super Mario. Says Super Awesome U with a $5 Super Chat donation. That's quote of the day. That's quote of the day, easily. Easily. I don't know how, I'm almost, I don't even want to read any more donations, practically. Unless there's a hundred. A hundred! No, not yet. Lazo! Lazo! Lazo! Lazo!
