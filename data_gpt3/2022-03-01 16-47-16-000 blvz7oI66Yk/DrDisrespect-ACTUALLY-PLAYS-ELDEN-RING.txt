 I am going to break something. I am going to break something. I feel like I'm absolutely going to destroy this game today. It's the same thing I heard with Hitman. Oh, Doc, you never played any of the Hitman? Yeah, good luck. Fucking set world records in that game the first day it came out. This is not going to be any different. Get it, go! Fuck, man! You're not a Dark Souls player. What does that mean? Huh? What does that mean? I mean, that's one of the biggest insults I've ever seen. There you go! Good job, man! I can't believe you let him out of the game. I've properly prepared myself for this moment by not playing any of the Dark Souls games. No need. Let's get inside of the arena, and for the next four hours, we're going to be creating our character. I mean, the name alone could take 10 minutes, champ. California sun got you, huh? Hey, two words. Sunscreen. That's one word? That's two words. I don't care if they combined it. It's two words. Nosebridge with. Got it. I know exactly what that is. I'm going to bring this together. Oh, oh, oh. I want this guy to be just really awkward. Awkward, but dominant. All right. Zero deaths thus far, champs. Lupu said a death count. I don't know what you mean. We don't got that, Alex, right? Starting game with this character. Is this it? Yes. Well, then leave. Tell us. Wait a minute. I don't want to skip. Doc, I have an interview for a better job and I'm nervous. Any words of encouragement? Says Chris Miller with the Five Hour of the Nation. What are you nervous about? It's a better job. Let me stop you right there. Hey, mute the sound. What are you nervous about? It's a better job. Why does that make you nervous? You know why it makes you nervous? You're already thinking in a negative energy. You don't want to ruin this opportunity, right? Like you don't want to blow this opportunity. So you're already thinking into a negative type of energy right now. That's the mistake right now. I need you to put that. I need you to flip it upside down. Use it as a strength. You know what I mean. You do. I think I'm gonna try that Eldon ring out when it comes out. Are you? Yeah, might as well. Might as well jump in. You ever played Dark Souls? No, I played a lot of Skyrim. Okay. Make of thyselves that which he desire. Be it a lord, be it a god. But should he fail to become Lord at all, he will be forsaken. Amounting only to sacrifices. The The The Dallian is here, man. What an intro. Here we go. Once I just get familiar with the controls, it's game over. It's gonna be game over. Easy. So no, I guess no tutorial or anything about movement weapons, etc. I mean, that's fine. I just I wish I was a little bit more prepared for that. Look at how he's sitting there. He's ready. He's just trying to understand this world that he wound up like just a different dimension, man. He's trying to understand it all. And how do you use it? What the hell? No. Dude, I keep pressing the wrong one. No. Touch the bloodstain. Let's go traverse through the mist. All right. The soldier to perform a counterattack immediately after blocking an enemy guard canters. Artie immediately after blocking an attack guard counter. Got it. Like this. Watch. That's right, I got to lock on this dude. Easy. Let me just say, let me slowly but surely let me just feel it out just a tad. Yeah. How's he looking? I don't know. The hood's kind of ruining it. It's the outfit that's not working right now. We'll find it. We'll eventually find it when we beat the game today. Whoa, we going out? Is this, I can't, I can't. The Eagle. Look at that thing. Look at this Eagle just staring out here. Look at this champs. Look at this. Just staring out there, man. The valley below awaits the two time. The open world's calling and I've arrived. One by one, boss by boss, they go down for good. The Dallion. Let's begin. Jesus Christ. You want to fight? All right, let's fight. Can I get some zoom ins on my guy? I mean, shit, I spent 45 minutes creating him. My dude kind of looks sick right there. Except he kind of looks too green, man. We threw the color gray on him. Hmm. I think we're refused for now. I've got... Stop asking me for things. You must accept, no, accept her for level up. Wrong. Come on, guys. I know what I'm doing here, you know? Let me show you. Come on, block it. Fuck, man, the shield's so slow. No. Let's get the fuck out of here. See ya. Go! Dude, I'm... Wow. I want this site. This site, this whole site with all these guys, it's mine. This is so slow, dude. I fucking hate you. Drop frames! Drop frames are... Fuck, man. I feel like I'm playing Ghost Recon from Nintendo. Always lagging, huh? Bring your dog, too. Bring your little puppy. I know. Come here. Come here, puppy. It's a pretty flawless run right here. Dude, lock on, man. What the fucking controls? Let me wipe my nose on my mic. Not a big deal. One at a time now, champs. One at a time. Ah! We're expecting that one, aren't we? Okay, I'll take that. Dr. Nelina. Okay. Okay. Okay. Will do. So we need to find this... There's this horse, champs? We got to find this guy who's, like, on the ledge or something. Dormill, yeah. We're looking for a gold horse. Is that him? There he is! All right, let's go get him. Let's go get him. Come on! There it is! I think we need a little action. I've only died nine times. I've been playing this game for four and a half hours, champs. Way, way better than LuBu. You know what? I'm fighting this boss. Fuck it. We're getting in. Ball, ball, ball. There you go. Fucking beautiful. Fun game. Really athletic, agile game. It's really fun. What's my guy doing, man? What's he locking on to? Oh. Look at this. I'm the best! Welcome to the Champions Club. I know I haven't been reading donations. Doc, thoughts on this compared to Skyrim? Skyrim was... Playmores. It's all around. It's a different type of game. I don't know why you even compare them.
