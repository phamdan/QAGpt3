 Just unbelievable man, unbelievable! There's no fucking way! This guy doesn't fucking have any shields, it's a shotty! It's a shotty! And this dude, oh my god the aim assist fucking sucks! It's a child's game out here ladies and gentlemen! I need a new game, I need a new game! I need one for my sanity! My bad, oh my god! No, no! Let me hold out my heartbeat for the whole time! There's a truck coming around the back! What?! No! No! Why the fuck, I couldn't get out! What the fuck? No! Oh god! How do I fucking lose this?! You think I'm stupid? You think I'm fucking stupid? Huh? What the fuck are you doing? Dude I had to go over a mantle, why am I man delay?! Why am I on a man delay?! Fucking slide! Why is it taking so long?! Get over the wall man! Fucking go! Slide! Get out of the rocks man! Slide! I spent four hours unplugging and replugging everything inside here. I don't want to see no orange boxes, it's right on the left side of the screen indicating that there's packet loss! There's packet loss every time! Every time I get in a fight! This game is so disinteresting, so boring, so generic! 95 year old man! Can get away! With aim assist every day! Brand new season! He ran away! Look at that fight! Look at that fight! Holy shit! Can we get a clip?! I would like to see a clip! Let's see a clip of this guy just......disappearing in the shadows! I mean just check out how this dude just fucking disappears champs! Look at this! I can barely see him until I zoom in and then boom boom! Missed my snipe, right? Right there, you know, you're probably thinking, okay that's where it started. Where'd he go?! Just like that he's gone! Look at him! Just like that, poof! He's gone! In the middle of my conversation! In the middle of my sentence! This guy, like this guy is that good! Where'd you go?! Where is he?! Where is he?! I don't give any of that information! Doom doom! Boom! No dead silence, nothing, huh? Nothing, huh? Didn't even have dead silence on it! For a limited time, Champions Club until June 11th. You can use code Gamerobics on any order of... Gamefuel at the Gamefuel.com website and you receive a limited edition Gamerobics cassette tape. That's right, boom! Limited edition! Nice, nice, let's get out of here! How does that not kill him?! Holy fuck! This guy fucking sucks! Dude, that's so fucking stupid! Why you fucking kill me?! I'm fucking dead! That's what I lose to! Fucking jump out the window, man! Run! Why are you weak? What are we doing? Let me see what you're doing the whole fucking time, you fucking pussy! Fucking pick it up! Fucking load it up! I don't know how I lose this! I must have the fucking worst connection to these servers, man. That I should not lose! Fucking training wheels, man! And let's turn down the sun glare! This just fucking makes sense! Headshot! If you're not gonna feed me the information that's happening right fucking behind me. Right behind me! Pussy! Go play the fucking game, you pussies! Fuck! Fucking... What?! Fucking pull the shotty, man! Behind the fucking tree?! No! I'm around the corner! Are you fucking kidding me?! Unbelievable how fucking lucky this guy is! Can't even get a fucking... fucking trashy-ass flash in! How about that guy?! Is there not another game?! Fuck this game, man. Unbelievable! I swear, there's so many virgins playing this fucking game. This audio in this game is pathetic! Go play the game! Go get a live! Go play the game! It's fucking terrible! Blows my mind! Because nobody played it on PC! Nobody! Can't hear fucking a thing! I really want to fucking snap this! I really want to snap this in half, Raven! Hey, huh? I really want to fucking snap it in half! Holy shit! The enemy took that one, but we'll be back to finish the job. Is this what everyone does?! Is this crouch?! Fucking walk?! Is that what everyone does?! Holy shit! Grow some balls! This guy is in the fucking staircase! Not moving! Oh my god! I keep walking around and not sprinting around and still fucking get away with it! Keep interrupting me. You're not being patient. Like, what do you want me to be? Are you going to be patient or do you want me to be patient? Like, we can have this conversation about patience. I don't really want to fucking talk about it. All I know is that I'm lathered up from head to tip-toe, man. I am vaseline-ed out of my mind. Okay, the slick daddy, aka the Ethiopian boys and the caterpillar boy, who wants to chew, who wants to eat, who wants to feed, who wants to suffocate, who wants to squeeze into fucking death. Every single time. And that's exactly what we're going to do moving forward inside of the stream. The orange boxes on the left side of the fucking... right over there! The orange boxes, way over there! We're going to make sure that we get rid of them. And how do we get rid of them? We eliminate people from the lobby. Because the... here's... now we're going into the explanation of it all. Where you have to have a little bit of patience. Or do I have a little bit of patience? Because I don't know if anybody's playing this game on the West Coast because we're not getting inside of a lobby. Boom! There's the lobby. Good. Wide open. It's powerful. Now we're in. Right? But let me go ahead and go back to killing and eliminating people from the lobby one at a time. The orange boxes, they disappear. Because there's less connections. Upload both. Both. Download and upload. Both of them. Arr, arr, arr. Good job, Kevin! Good job! Good job, Kevin! You did such a good job, Kevin!
