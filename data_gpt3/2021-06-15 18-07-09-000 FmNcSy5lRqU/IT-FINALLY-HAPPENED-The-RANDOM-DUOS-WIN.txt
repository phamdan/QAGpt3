I speak Spanish and... Portuguese. Hello, how are you? Good, good, good. And you? Good old United States of America. Whoa. The name... is Doctor Disrespect. Move it! JESSE! I wonder if we're ever going to be handing out prizes. Ever. I wonder if any of these teammates got the guts. The will to kill. The drive to succeed. The mentality to bleed. I hope so. Let's do it! Oh, you're already thinking Superstar, huh? I'm not the one watching, come on, I already know you want to turn it up. It's not that slow, I'll help you. Eliminate all targets in the AIO. Dead sound. Oh! You fucking alive, bitch! Sorry. Let him know! Oh, right here. He's broken. Watch out. There you go. Grab that bounty. Oh yeah, maybe we grab that bounty. Oh shit. No, no, no, no. I got one shot. Second one. Plating, plating, plating. Pushing, pushing, pushing. Thought, he thought. See ya. Here we go. Oh, he's still got, oh yeah. Still got her. I'll push out, I'll push out your piece, bro. Two of them, two of them. Stay alive, stay alive. Oh, he's so fucked up. Look at this guy, both of them had self revive. Now we're having some fun. Trying to get marked, requesting strike. Oh, he's trying to break. Oh my god. Oh shit, I got snipped. Oh, I got snipped. Oh shit, I got sniped. Oh shit, he's over here. Watch him. Cancel that. I gotta get... I'll go get a free kill. I'll go get a free kill, it's all good. Oh, he's so one shot. His teammate was right around the corner. Yep. I heard him. Same desperate dude. Lot of desperation everywhere. 90 left, you got 9, dude? You gonna put up 30? I'd like to, I'd like to. Just a warm up game. Come on back. Man, you missed my 15 earlier when I told you you were gonna put on a show, bro. I swear. Look it up, it even says kyebosschris15, bro. Yeah, it was in the beginning, I knew you were doing your intro and stuff. I'm never hurt whenever you miss anything. Sometimes a Lambo's engine is just real loud and you tend to miss things, you know? Ah, dude. Understandable. Appreciate that, Chris. Come on, let's get rid of those orange boxes, bro. I'm hitting dead silence. Fucking timing of that. Insane. Ah, fuck. Absolutely insane. Go get your free kill now. Time to earn your freedom, soldier. You gave him a proper sword. Stand by for reinforcements. Hot track complete. You're clear for high fire. Easy win. Easy. Let's go ahead and get some. Got him. Ooh, baby. Do you have a sniper now or are you running that... I'm running the Ram 7. I usually run the AMAX Mac, dude. Get spired sometimes, you know? For sure. Definitely in red. Out the door, out the door. You just got sniped. I'm gonna go get you. We got a guy behind us. That's the key. I got one down. One of them, see him. See him! Come on, Chris! Let's go! I'm thinking about getting the snipe. Oh, left? Oh, this is terrible. Downed one. Got the finish. Another one, down. That's the finish. Down. Let's go, baby! Let's go, come on! I gotta get your Twitter. Whatever your handle is. Your Twitter handle. Did you disrespect? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chris, what's your Twitter? Hold on, it's TrashGamer. I think under... Yeah, it's TrashGamer. And it's TrashGMR. TrashGamer underscore GMR. Boom, following. Congratulations to Chris. Shout out to TrashGamer Chris. I liked him, good personality. Good sport. You got the job done. Today's the day inside of the arena. We finish the job. One game at a time. One peak at a time. Step number two. You step into the gymnasium. And if you're in Mexico, it's gimnasio. You get on the bicicleta. If you're in the United States, that's bicycle. We need you, Vanir. Than you've ever been. I need you protein out of your mind. You put away the illegal steroids. And you didn't get them from me. I need you focused in! I feel like I could take this guy down here with this. I'm the champion! Champions Club, that is a good old check mark if I've seen it. And things are starting to get a little intense. And as far as I'm concerned, that's just the way the doctor likes it. Going it back to the 6-foot-8 Gaming great on the main stage. How bout a pupsie banami? How come you pupsie banami? How come you pupsie banami? I've got diarrhea. I don't know what else to say right now. I mean it is bubbling. I am not a robot. I am not a robot. Boom! Boom! Woo! Easy! Hey, check it off, baby. Check that off. Bop! It's nothing. To the two-time back-to-back, six-foot-eight gaming great. That is another check mark. And boy, oh boy, right over my right shoulder. That's exactly what that screen gets. It's a 100% stamp of approval. Guarantee win. Ladies and gentlemen, wow, wow, wow. Moving on to the final, to the final game in the Triple Threat Challenge, Warzone. Yikes! We're a little different. There you are. There you are. We're a little different around here. See what I'm saying? We're a little fucking different. Get the fuck out of my game. Let me have a look. Let me have a look. There you are. They're always a little curious, aren't they? Trust me, I want the fight. This is that pussy. One at a time. It's showtime. Oh, that's it. That's a win, baby. Hell yeah. Well done, well done, Champions Club. Doctor putting on one hell of a performance from the very beginning of the game all the way to the end. I mean, we talk about sniping and then we talk about Doctor disrespects the sniping. Am I right? It all came down to a truck, Doc's vehicle, and a riot shield running pogo sticks. Incredible game design. Raven, you're knocking it out of the park. The solos are just high octane. But ladies and gentlemen, the Doctor did it. That's right. Boom. Stamp of approval just like that. Ladies and gentlemen, the triple threat challenge has been completed. Triple threat challenge completed. Anybody saying, oh, you didn't get that last game. Shut the fuck up, man. When I grab it, it's 50, it's like a 90 degree. I keep my elbow up here. Got it. But when I take a sip, it kind of feels like it's all going to pour down my mouth. And like maybe over my, just try it. OK. Yeah, it comes out too fast. I don't know. Like it's you can't even see the logo. Hey, like this.
