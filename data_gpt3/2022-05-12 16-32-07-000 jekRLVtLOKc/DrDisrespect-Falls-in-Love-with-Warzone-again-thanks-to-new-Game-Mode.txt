 Warzone live event today King Kong vs Godzilla original original theme and I really really can't wait. Hey John! Yeah Fred? Dude I got a killer idea for our huge Call of Duty IP. What's that Fred? So check it out. Dude have you ever heard of Godzilla? Yeah you know what? What's that? Have you heard of King Kong? No way bro are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yeah Godzilla vs King Kong on Calgera? Holy shit Robert Taylor? What the? I'm telling you right now Zee Lainer the two tons side by side we're the first to complete previous Warzone events and we just might be the first to complete today's event when it goes live. I hear you clicking your keyboard all over the place Zee. You hear me clickity clacking? And I hear you clicking and clapping getting all excited for this Godzilla King Kong event huh? Whoa what's this? It's the meta cloud setup. Zee we're into something. Oh I see it I see it. Titans Godzilla and Kong are unleashed on the island be wary the arrogance of man is thinking nature's in their control. Control you want to you want to have the second one Zee? Go ahead. I'll get the second yeah yeah yeah. Monarch has set up camp to research the Titans collect intel and kills contracts crates or by shooting the Titans to gain a Titan scream device kill streak capable of directing the Titans wrath. Titan frenzy the Titan scream device is still a prototype and can send the Titans into a deadly frenzy stagger the Titans with heavy weaponry and Monarch may compensate you. That got a little awkward at the end. You know what I mean? Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Okay okay continue. It must have taken him like three weeks to render this video out. Yeah same here. Boom! That's pretty that's pretty nice. I think they're gonna throw us right in Zee get ready. Oh here we go and cue. You hear this guy screaming? Yes that's what I was talking about. Yes I didn't mean to put us in with randoms. Do we back it out or do we what do we do? This is kind of awkward now. It's up to you man your call. No it's not. It is. I know so so it's your responsibility. Okay you're right you're right. All right peace out. Was that the right move? That's a fantastic move I think that was the right move. Okay okay okay. Let me put that on let me put that on no Phil. Whoa hell to the king. Here we go. Jesus. All right listen up boys. There's a fucking monster down there. Good luck. Look at King Kong standing there. They look so tiny though when you're up in the air. Jesus. Yeah let's go let's go. Go go go. This reward is a gas mask. Titan frenzy deal damage to stagger the Titans. All right let's get rid of the Titan real quick. All right let's do it. I have no idea what's going on. I have zero idea what's going on. Like is it this is it? Is this it? I I guess this is it. I thought I was gonna be like inside of Godzilla kind of like you know Ghostbusters where they're inside of the Statue of Liberty and then they're controlling it and it's big mechanical device and then like you know something like that. I just I quit. I don't know what else to say man. I had to shut that down. Holy shit. Yeah shut that down. What am I seven years old? Oh man. So that like that is it. We've experienced everything that you can experience in that game mode Doc. We really have. Like there's nothing more. There's nothing more to do. I've heard from other sources that even if you win the game you nothing happens. You don't get anything. You don't get any kind of like. The only thing I will say about the event Z positive is that I didn't have to pay anything to experience it other than my time. Exactly but how much is your time worth Doc? It's a lot. So I to that point. Yeah. So when you think about it that way Doc tell me what your perspective is now. Holy shit these guys got me huh. They got you. I think they got you. Oh. I was watching Kim there they just beat it and then nothing happened. I was watching Tim like go fucking watch them. You see what I'm saying. And now we've expanded inside of the arena gifted subs. You can go to Timmy's channel and get the bro treatment on how it all works. Bro this is what you got to do bro. Bro you got to click here bro. I love the future. I love the future bro. Bro I love the future. Bro I love the future. YouTube Gaming represent record represent. Or you could just fucking figure it out on your own here. Timmy he sees a live event. He sees the opportunity to make a little YouTube video. Yeah he's done. He's gone. And then that's it. And that's it. He's done. There's just no passion from Timmy these days. I just thought I'm not feeling it and I'm not really feeling it. What's Timmy doing today? People go. And um. Now all he does is like drive jeeps and say bro. The video today. The YouTube video is going to be a live event like reaction. I was going to tickle King Kong's feet. Tickle his little fucking pinky toe. I was going to get right in there man. You know what I mean. He's probably got some really bad toe jam. Oh my god. It's disgusting to think about that word toe jam. What is toe jam? What's toe jam? It's like when all your sweat and sock fluffies and like just bacteria in between the toes. Let me see if I have toe jam. Yeah check. Take a look. Let's see. Well I think we're good. Anyways you know what I've been addicted to. It's just YouTube shorts. Like if you have the YouTube app on your flip phone and you open that thing up. It automatically defaults to the YouTube shorts. So like boom it throws it into like something that pertains to your interests and your search history whatever. The algorithm of your likes. So I'm immediately greeted with a quick video that most likely I will find okay kind of entertaining and then I swipe to the next one and I can swipe and it just keeps going. And I'll sit there and swipe for a long time man. It's kind of an addiction. It's actually kind of scary. It takes up a lot of my time these days. I got to figure out how to get out of it. I'm wearing Doc shorts right now and those Doc shorts are a little tight on me. Hey Doc do you have King Kong in your trunk? Sandman with the Fight of the Nation. Well you've seen how small the trunk is in the front of the Lamborghini Diablo BT. I don't know what you're talking about. Take him down. You're such a bitch. Oh he goes you're such a bitch. Is that how he sounded too? Oh that's exactly how he sounded. You're such a bitch. That's not very nice. That isn't nice at all. I mean what did I say? Like what did I ever do to you man? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO The End
