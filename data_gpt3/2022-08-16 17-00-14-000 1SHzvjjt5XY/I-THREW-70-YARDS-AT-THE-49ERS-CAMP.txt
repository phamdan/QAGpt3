 Good evening. I'm Dr Disrespect. Take a look. We're at Levi's Stadium, the home to the San Francisco 49ers. And I'm telling you this right now. There's a lot of doubt that the two-time can't throw at 70 yards. Well today, that's exactly what we're going to do. I've been thinking about the throw a lot lately. It's affected me so deeply. I'm a little concerned about the long snapper who's going to deliver the ball to my hands. That's beside the point. I rented out the stadium. Dr Disrespect fit. Custom fit. I'm going to need to feel good and I'm also going to need to look good. Excuse me. This is my first day here. Do you know where I can... To the top. I like your style. Yeah, so when we talked about me working for the Niners, I meant me being on the field. Yeah. Printer's not working. Alex! Excuse me. Hey boss. First day on the job. Where's the field? Am I up here or trying to find the field? So the plan is 70 yards. Okay listen up. We're going 70 yards. That's the game plan. That's the magic number. 70 yards. 70 yards. Hey good to see you. Good to see you. Good to see you too. What are we going to be doing today? We're going to be throwing 70 yards minimum. Who's going to be the guy we're throwing to? It's going to be good old classic George Kittle. I worry for George's hamstrings if you're going to be able to keep up with your arm strength. That's a good point. You're not going to be warming up at all? No warm up. No warm up. That's how you go. That's how I do it. If I blow the rotator cup out, so be it. How's that arm looking? Two times. There he is. How's it going? Howdy! We'll get you a K ball here. Those are for quarterbacks. These are for specials. This is a specialist ball. Specialist ball? So which one in your opinion is easier to throw? For long samples, that one. Oh, well then I want this one. George! It's untightened. It's taller than this guy. How are you doing? Wow. It's incredible, isn't it? It's a structure. In person, it's something else. Oh my gosh. Thanks for coming out, man. Hey, thank you for having me. You ready to catch the 70? Where are we dropping? We're dropping 70 yard bombs. That's where we're dropping. That's right. How are you doing? Hey, how are you doing? You guys are big. Oh, relax. You're sitting on the floor. What do you mean? You have to throw at 70 yards. Well, that's the goal. Are you loose? I'm a little loose. Damn straight up on my tiptoes. I don't want to see this picture on eBay. Tippy toes. What's that? All right. I got to look good. You look good, baby. You cannot throw a football 70 yards. For you to throw a football 70 yards? Yes. I'm going to give you $1,000. $1,000. $1,000. I'm really going to do a 70 yard bomb. Do you think he can do it? It's hard to disrespect what can't he do. You know what? A part of me wants to believe it though, Doc. We're going to shoot a video. I'm going to throw a football 70 yards. What was that yardage? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, totally. I didn't even prepare. I haven't thrown a football in a long time. Ethiopian poisonous caterpillar. Deadly. It consumes 20 to 30 percent anything that you consume. That's a good statistic. Wow. I look really good in your glasses. I appreciate it, man. Hey, I appreciate it. Can I see you at a game hopefully? Yeah, and online. Let's do it. See you, man. All right. Take care. Appreciate it. The mark that we hit, 70 yards. We did it. We came. We delivered. We dominated. And boy, oh, boy, the start of the season. There's nothing like it. An incredible day. Shout out to the unit within the San Francisco 49ers organization for inviting the two-time to compete. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You did it. We've been Â£5,100 Nickelback accompanied by R loop entr cesand You got it baby! Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, I feel good. Any questions? Doc, Doc! Yeah? How do you feel about the audio in the latest VR? Did we just not see me throw the football 70 yards?
