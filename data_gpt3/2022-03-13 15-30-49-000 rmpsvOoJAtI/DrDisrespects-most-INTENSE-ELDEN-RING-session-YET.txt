 We've made it pretty far. We still got a long ways to go. And the adventure up to this point, one of a kind, legendary. But we got a long ways to go. Whoa! I guess we're going to the castle. Look at this place. Yeah! That place looks sick. We gotta go there, man. I think we found our little entrance right in there, huh? At the tippy top. But only halfway up. I'm too buff for this place. I can tell you that right now. I mean, just look at this presentation. I mean, look at the presentation of this game. They want me to go inside of the castle and that's exactly what we're going to do. What a crazy world. Look at this place. I guess we jump on a platform to go up and around. Is that what's happening here? That's what we got to do. Easy read, right? Come on! What the hell is this? What the fuck is that? Okay. Oh, it's... There's just one. One easy little guy in here. Look at him. You want to gamble? You did. My guy's so fucking pathetic! What was that? Am I dead? How you doing? You had your brother join in out of nowhere. All right. It's time to get rid of this fucking act. Got me, didn't you? Dead. I'm dead. He does it again, man. I'm dead. I'm dead. There's no way. That's a deadly carry, whatever that is that he's doing. It's literally one shot. You got me on that side, huh? I'm really... I'm going to close chat down. I'm going to. A lot of fucking professional dead soul players, huh? What organization you signed to. Great stab. That's a great one-two combo. I got to step it up right here. Do I put a stamp of approval? Remember, I just don't throw them around like loose change. The guaranteed stamp of approval personalized. Guarantee. I think I'm going to throw one out right now. I'm putting it in the pond. I'm making a wish. Didn't want to do it! Am I out of stamina? Is that why? Okay. Jesus. It wasn't really that hard, man. I just made it hard. That's the problem. Whoa! Is this a big boss or what? Is this it? It all comes down to this? I'm going to save that for the next stream. I feel like I can get her one time. It's the whole like spawn sprint, jump down, go to the bridge, pass the two balls, go down the elevator through the door. The first step, which is boring, right? Go find the person is kill them. The ball breaks. She comes down. Boom, boom, boom. She's not attacking me. It's a boring fight. I just have to go through that whole process just to get to the fight that I want. We're fresh. We have maximized interest in energy levels. Steroids from Guadalajara Jalisco flowing through my veins right now. Ripped out of my mind. Vanier than I've ever been. The jawline ready to slice and dice and cut. Okay, here we go. This is where it begins! A part of my name is Frenzy Twitch. Of the last queen of Caria. Renala of the full moon. I told you the first try at me. Hey, come on, baby. Not even close. Come on, man. Let's move it along, baby. Like, what do we do now? Um, don't need to get here. I think that's what we're going to do. That's the next phase is getting that monument to open up this side of the map a little bit. I want to know what's going on in this world. I'm getting up there. I'm wiping out this whole village. I don't care if it slows me down. I'm wiping out the entire village. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be back. I'll be back. Welcome. Glad you dropped in. Remember, my objective right now is to open up this map. I want to know. I want to know what's going on. There's the castle. There's the one everyone wants the two time to go to everyone, the entire world. And that's exactly what our next step is in our quest to become the greatest RPG gamer of all time. Show you how easy it is to kill these guys upstairs. Actually a joke at this point. Let me show you. We should do. I bought you. Oh, he missed it. the McCutcher past that baby sace is almost here, and I'm Terrified, he didn't invite for first time dad. Yes, build a half pipe. In the backyard, get them ready. And they're going to learn rollerblades. We're doing the castle today. The Khalid Castle. Baby, baby, baby, we're in! Let's see what we're made of. I almost feel like I should go diarrhea before I really dedicate. Champions, welcome. The stars have aligned. The festival is nigh. The mightiest demigod of the shattering awaits you. Oh yeah? The celebration of war. Let's go! The Radon Festival! Yes, nice. Ready as I'll ever be. Bring it, baby. Allow me to paint you the full picture. Okay, please do. I'm going to eat my, if you don't mind, spam and cup of noodles. Ramen. What the fuck is this? Ready as I'll ever be. Dude, I'm not strong enough to beat this guy. Ready as I'll ever be. You want a flawless run, champs? I'm going to give you one. I want to give it to you. Ready as I'll ever be. All right, you guys, follow me. He's just a little guy. He's right over this hill. There he is. Good luck, guys. My college made it to the D1 NCAA Tourney for the first time in program history since moving to D1 in 2008. Let's go Bryant Bulldogs. This is David Maroll. How does Bryant get the entire school and program, I mean, entire university behind this sports program for the tournament? You know, I think it's a big opportunity. They got to take advantage of it. Your small school is the first time you're going to the tournament. If I'm the university or school, you better believe everyone is going to know what's happening. Make it easy for transportation, buses, travel, whatever you can do. Just to get smashed by 60 points in the first round.
