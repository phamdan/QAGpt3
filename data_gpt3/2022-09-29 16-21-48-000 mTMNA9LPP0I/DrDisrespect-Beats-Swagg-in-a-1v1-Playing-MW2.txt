Favorite Call of Duty of all time well, I mean if you I Feel like in terms of an overall complete package of a Call of Duty I think it's black ops 2 for me from just from a public standpoint and all the DLC and The map design and the fiction and the way the weapons felt like the public match Experience was was fun, but then they added that whole league system, and they just nailed it right I think they nailed the pacing of the game right the level design I feel like that was the purest Call of Duty now There's like you know there's obviously extremes of like what was the funnest one or what was the best one for sniping and all that shit But for me like that was the that was it what about you? I mean BLT is a great one I think for me when I started like as far as like public matches and like what I do Modern for three was was so was so fun to me like the maps were I loved every almost every single map was great Specialist was amazing the guns felt really good as well, too, so I'd have to say monitor three hmm Hey cod for not getting any love huh?
