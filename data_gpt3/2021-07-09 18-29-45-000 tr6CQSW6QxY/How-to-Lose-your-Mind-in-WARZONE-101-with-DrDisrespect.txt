 Uh oh! Here comes a helicopter! What do we do guys? I think I'm gonna go get him. Down one, got him! Yeah! Having such a good time. Do you see how fucking fooded this game is? This is such a fucking joke! Fuck you, doctor. Alien 1, they give it a pointy and super chat look. It's Raul with a grr-aul! Acting like a tol in doul! He's like a gaul! Too cool for skaul! A jaul! Who rules in the affinity pool! Yeah, it's Raul! Where's your fucking audio? Where is it? CoyoteSB, they give it a five. Hey doc, wrote you a poem. Doc's vest is red. His mullet is black. And that's as far as I got so far. Enjoy your vacation, Mr. Two-Time. Thanks. Fuck! This game fucking sucks! It does! I would not hit a fucking guy! Because he dead silenced! Hey doc, can you help me summon the invisible swordsman? Absolutely. Shtoor-mor snakarair, Ungantight rin nostair-gmag-rar Khur, nough khost Animooh contract eenar anhafromstar! Ah! I can't break the glass! Thank you. I was not scared at all. Polly! Polly! Hey Polly! Are you there Polly? You got a microphone? Polly you got a mic! I just wanted to make sure. Natalie Benzak thank you for the 10 in Super Chat. Hey Doc, do you ever tire of being freaking awesome? I'm not sure if you've ever heard a Lamborghini door open. The sound of it. I put special sound effects in mine. I mean mine's a little bit different than the stock Diablo VT. Like when I open my door, it's a... Right here? Let me look at it! And I also installed some of these little steam machines underneath. So the thing's smoking every time I open it up and close it. And I walk right through it. It's amazing. To answer your question, do I ever tire of being freaking awesome? No, not even close. Right behind you. What a bunch of idiots. I'm on a whole other level baby! You're probably thinking, Doctor, why are you wearing grandpa sweatpants? How about you watch your ugly looking mouth? These are combat athletic sweatpants. Designed to keep the marble bag in its place comfortably. Whoa! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! What is that metal thing in the top left? I don't know. I don't get it. It just ruins the whole immersive experience. I don't know what that metal thing is on the top left. Doctor, why don't you crank it, Doctor? Doctor, something's wrong with your broadcasting. It's really... I'm gonna go watch someone else. I'm gonna go watch someone else because there's a metal thing on the top left of your screen. And I don't know what to do with myself. Here I am on a Wednesday, sitting in my mama's house. Trying to eat my macaroni and cheese and drink my little chocolate milk. Mommy, I want some more chocolate milk! I want my flan shell and vitamin! Mommy, can I go outside and play? No, I get all my homework! I just want to sit here and play Fortnite! Ahhh! Alright, I need to calm down. Michael Hicks, thank you for the 10. Great win, but what was that you guys censoring the word fuck for? Was that YouTube? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm allowed to say fuck anytime I want. You know what I mean? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. But when I say fuck, that means it's amplified, right? I mean, I can say fuck. Anytime I want, man. But when I really want... You can't see... You can't... Haytham, thank you for the $15 donation. Amy Wine, streamer, has an intro. That's great. That's right. I don't know. I don't even know what you mean by intro. I just set up a couple cameras and they capture me heading to the arena. I mean, like, what's... Gotta feel good today. Play something else than Warzone. What the fuck do you want me to play? Hmm. Not moving right now, champs. You see, we got our games in that were fun. And now it's just a little desperate. MPK. This guy's such a terrible gamer too. Holy shit. Oh, man. Why don't you clean up your act around here, man? I know. Every fucking game has a hacker now. Oh, I'm losing brain cells. I am losing brain cells. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 100%. Yeah, yeah. I'm looking too good. I'm smelling too good. I'm too buff, too ripped. There you go. Let's fucking posture up on these motherfuckers. Man, the shoulders are already back. Oh, shit. The ponytail, dripping. Trust me. The ponytail, dripping. Oh, his friend fell off. Yeah, yeah. It's 1v2, we got him. Easy, easy collapse. Let's go get this other guy. He doesn't belong in our game. Oh, the game's running smooth now. Oh, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. I got him. Right here, right here. Nothing, nothing. I mean, oh, baby. Oh, no way. Are you the real? You're lying. Yeah, the two time. No, yeah. No, no, no, no, no. There's no way. Back to back. Are you streaming right now? I am, man. I've got 100 million in the arena. I can't do what you do. What do you mean no way? Where are you playing from? From inside of a $985 million arena. Yeah. Dude, I really am on this dude's stream. What? Oh, my God. This dude's like super famous. I'm on his stream right now. That microphone you got is pretty sweet. You like it? Oh, I'm sorry. Am I too loud? No, no, no. I don't know if you're streaming. You're probably hearing your stream echo through. I got the Steel series. Oh, shit. Am I allowed to say that? Not on this channel. Okay. That's illegal. That's illegal. I got a decent headset. Hey, let's get it. Oh, shit. What the fuck? I got you. Fucking movement. He can't handle the movement. Oh, no. It all comes down to a fucking stupid ass stun. Oh, my God. Ruins the entire game. I'm such a big fan. Thank you so much. Appreciate the game, baby. Thank you. Hey, Doc. How come you get a win but not me? Because you suck. Thank you.
