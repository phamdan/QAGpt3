 So, uh, how's your day going it's fucking horrible like an update requires Shit! Get around! Let's wake up! Fucking load up the sniper! Fucking... It's a joke! Fucking bunny hop when I shoot. It's the only mechanic that we can do. Someone... Fucking dead silence! Fucking game, just so pathetically bad! How do I lose that? I mean, where are you guys? No! Dr. Battlefield 2042 beta is live now! See, we're in a fucking $20,000 tournament! Boom! Dead silence! Fucking stupid! I mean, guess why? Cause he's fucking dead silenced! Who the fucking thought? Three guys! Halo, Halo, Halo, Halo, Halo, Halo, BR, Battle Royale, Big T, it's live, it's all live! Shut the fuck, man! Come on, I don't even want to look at the chat! Look at them! Look at them all! Look at them! Oh, look at them! Look at these fucking cockroaches! Look at them all! It's a fucking... It's not fair! I can't talk! This guy's fucking laying down on the roof! Big stack. Get involved, you can win some prizes. But most importantly, it's an interactive experience, and we're just here to have fun playing one of our all-time favorite games, Warzone. Fuck. Great intro, Doc, man. 10 out of 10 right there. Nobody's playing this game anymore, Timmy! Like, no one normal! I'm not playing this game anymore, Timmy! I'm not playing this game anymore, Timmy! I'm not playing this game anymore, Timmy! I'm not playing this game anymore, Timmy! I'm not playing this game anymore, Timmy! Like, no one normal! Huh? Alright, man. Get me in there. Okay. I'm on my way. I'm dead. Because I'm running in fucking mud in this game! Hold to confirm! Get me the fuck out of it! God, I'm running in mud! I'm not going anywhere! I'm holding the sprint button! My guy's arms are going like this! Like, the view model's going like this, right? But, like, my screen? I'm not going anywhere. This is the speed of my player model going like this. You'd think he'd be fucking sprinting, right? Fucking sliding down stairs, moving around. But I'm literally going like five feet. Hey, guys! Don't mind me, I'm sprinting! While playing Apex. Oh, I made it into the Champions Club locker room. I'm still sprinting, but thank God I have a bunch of batteries and health bars and flatline and a shotgun. Peacekeeper. Hey, guys! There's a team coming our way! Let me turn around! There it is! I'm gonna slide your way! Protect me if you can! They're shooting me in my back! Someone help me out! I'm moving so fast, I'm blurry. But I'm really not going anywhere. That's what this fucking game feels like. There's just no fucking way! They're roof. Lights is itched. Oh, Mike! It's disgusting! 90 ping against a controller crackhead, you know? It ain't gonna cut it. I mean, it's just not gonna work out. It's insane! Yeah, I can't see. Look at this! Look at this! What am I playing? Look at this fucking... Look at this! Can you reset? Oh, nice shot. MPRG. Ah! The fucking manalina sucks in this game. How is he not dead? What? Stop firing! This guy got a 4p! How does he win that? How he fucking wins that? Spamming it? Holy shit! What? Fucking fire it! Oh! He's still able to fucking do it! Get up! Fuck, man! Get up! To your left! Come on! Are you hiding in the corner? He still wins it. He's fucking stunned and he still wins it. He killed me with a bullet. It's insane. I'm never playing fucking Vanguard after Tuesday again. I can't lose brain cells like this. I'm over it. Definitely over Call of Duty multiplayer. This is insane. It's just fucking insane. Oh! Doc's gone, Jack. I'm done. I'm done. Yeah, I closed it down. I hit max brain limit damage. Man. Brain damage limit. He actually survived longer than I thought. Craig Dinkovich, thank you for the 5-0 Super Chat. Doc, what is your favorite game to play? I've been playing a game. It's been Halo. Craig, have you not been by the stream? Have you not been by the stream lately, Craig? Get this guy. Fuck, man. Anybody see him? See, I don't feel that. I don't feel the fucking bullet hitting me. I don't hear him. I don't feel him. How does he not... How are we not fucking killing him? How? How? How? How? How do I lose that? How? How? Holy shit. One grenade. It just blows up. Why aren't you fucking sprinting? I'm pressing it down. He's one shot. No, he's one shot on my ex. You pussy. What's your fucking challenge? Is that not fucking five hits? Huh? You pussy? What the fuck am I shooting at? Bra, bra, bra, bra, bra. He don't... I shoot him, he walks through a grenade. I don't fucking get it. I don't get it. Are you the same person? Good job, Yuri. I can't sit in that little rat area. Yeah, we'll trade, huh? You'll walk through a grenade again. We had two spots where we choked heavy, bro. We had two spots where we choked heavy, bro. How do we get him out of here? Hey, Magzy, get the fuck out of the lobby! Yeah, but he just joined back. Did he? He said he joined. He said he rejoined. Yeah, now he's gone. I yelled at him. Ladies and gentlemen, we're on board. Timmy, Timmy, of course, backing all the way up. Scared to death. Doesn't want to challenge nothing. He takes a weird glimpse behind him. Glimpse behind him. Glimpse, glimpse. It doesn't matter what the fuck we're talking about because we're losing our mind playing Warzone. Oh, on the bike. Hey, how you doing? Nice fucking audio. You can really tell where audio is going to come from in this game. All you hear is this. That's the whole audio in this fucking game. Audio sucks. What? Holy shit! Do I not get audio? Look at this game! Holy shit. Oh my god, no! You can see how fast I go down! It's a joke! Orange boxes! Oh, I hate this! Oh my god! How does he fucking not go down? Why are you looking? I am like seven feet behind the corner! God, this game makes me so... It turns me into a demon. It fucking sucks! I'm tired of complaining about it. I'm tired of complaining about it. Pretty organic. Fucking stupid fucking game! It's a bunch of fucking idiots, man! Oh god, sorry champs. I know, that's pretty exposed. That's probably really negative. A lot of cuss words. A lot of R rated cuss words. Welcome to Caldera! A world full of paradise! Welcome to Caldera! A world full of paradise! Paradise! Paradise! Program more! I got you, I got you. We need more audio! We've seen it all! We've seen it all. We've seen it all from World War II. Let's start thinking outside the box. $4.2 billion per quarter IP and franchise. Let's start thinking outside of the box. You know? Fuck! I'll tell you right now, man. There's something about waking up at the La Casa. Knowing that when I go into my 8 car garage, that there's 4 Lamborghinis in there. You know what I mean? There's just something about it. It's a good feeling. So after today playing this map in this game, um... Code Air. Thank God. I got a Code Air. Game crashed. That's right, that's right. I'm getting real close to uninstalling this game and switching over to Battlefield 2042 where I lose 98% of my audience just because. I mean, that's just how close I am. I lost my fucking mind today! Oh God. Holy shit. Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!
