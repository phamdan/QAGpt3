 Ladies and gentlemen, we're jumping into a brand new beta experience. And we're going to be doing it alongside Dr. Lupo in a game they call the Cycle Frontier. We'll have to see what it's about before we jump into the Cycle, the Frontier. I'm hearing it's like Escape from Tarkov with Halo aliens mixed with Fortnite graphics and cartoons mixed with chickens. Anyways, we're jumping in. We're in! Jesus. I scare you. Are you in an intense fight right now? No, I was listening on my way through Waterfall and searching a cave for goodies. You scared the shit out of me. I'm trying to craft this Karma legendary sniper. Is that even possible? I'm not even close to getting that thing. The stuff required for that... So you're telling me I have a chance? There's always a chance, Doc. The fact that they only give you three missions to do at a time kind of does make it easier to manage. Get the stuff from the map when you deploy, crush anybody that gets in your way, get out, do it again. Alright, I'm ready. Alright, let's see here. Good drop, hopefully. Not in a shitty spot. All I want to do is get these guys out. Alright, we dropped north side of the map. Let's get you some money early. Oh shit, okay. You hear that? Yeah, yeah. Now check those. Grab pretty much everything you can. And then get these big rocks around the outside. Get that pickaxe out and start hacking away. Good stuff in here. Slowly but surely. Oh yeah, there is friendly fire by the way. Don't fucking shoot me in the back. I'm glad you told me that, backpack fool. Already? Okay. How much ammo did you bring? I brought a lot. I'd say probably a thousand rounds. Okay, let's get some bites then. I'm going to grab these. We got to start pushing people. Somebody just flew in behind us. Somebody just dropped in behind us, yeah. Back basically right where we were. We might be able to get them. Gordon, if you're trying to get PvP... It's all about PvP, baby. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We find them when we hunt them down, man. I don't know how the hell we get down from here. Without busting my ass. Got a trampoline though? Might be able to jump onto that? I'm going to test it. If I die... Shit. Okay. Beautiful. Be real careful, you could jump onto that though. There you go. Gah! You good? Yeah, just want to test out the health system anyways. But that's one of the things in TARGA that's frustrating is like people will beeline to the loot spots. Oh, we just got sniped at. 55 down below. You can look for the sniper glint, he's down there. Oh, shit. Careful, careful. Putting a USB stick in my wrist? Is there proximity chat in this game? There actually is, yeah. Good to know. I don't know what the default push and talk key is though. Hey, you around here? That's it, there it is. Din din din din din din din din din. I think they're scared of you. This thing kill you? Lands on your head? I have no idea. There's no way, right? You're playing... Doc! Ha ha. Doc, god damn it, Doc. The evac ship did 1,760,000 damage to me. Are you serious? It was just a test. I just killed a guy that was pushing up as you died. No! I was looking at your loot and he took half my health and I fucking snapped on him. I'm readied up. Alright, let's go! God, I like how we're just right back in it. So don't stand underneath the evac ship. He's up top, he's up top. He's on the little pad up there. Hey, how you doing? You got him, Doc! Oh shit. There you go. Jump down, he jumped down. He's coming to me. He's running. Oh, this guy has some stuff, you know it. Come back, little guy! Got him. Beautiful. Hit him once. Beautiful. Get him out! Shut up. Is that... Just testing the friendly fire, yeah? Yeah, it's doing a little Q&A here. Okay, okay. Everything working alright? How much damage did I just do? Not a lot, it's like maybe a centimeter on my screen. On my health bar. Just enough to just annoy you? Yeah, honestly. I'm not your guy to the right. I feel like he's right to left. Yeah, he's right here. There you go. Oh, he's right there. Oh, he's right there. Oh, he's right there. Should we go climb this? Yeah, there we go. Wait, somebody... I didn't call this. Did you call this? I did, I just wanted to get you a little excited. Jesus. Wait, I don't know if we can get up right here. Uh oh. Um... Um... Um... I can't get up over here. That's too bad. Oh wait, I'll see you in a little bit. I can't get up. Wait, Doc! Yep, just get right here. There's a mantle. There's a mantle. Come on, Gabe. Mantle right here. It's like right here. Doc! Oh, you're about to leave me behind. No, I'm not going to leave you behind. I'm going to stay here. I got it. I got it. Just don't get killed. Shit. Oh. My whole life flashed before my eyes. Imagine that shot you threw at the needle and hit somebody in the way. I've seen in COD, a small boulder will stop me. Uh, somebody's coming in literally right next to us, northwest. Sniper, in front of me? Yep, I see him. Boom, see ya. Two of them, two of them. No, he's right in front of me. Got him. Nice work, Doc. Let's go! Did I hit him? Yeah, he's dead. That's two! Number 36 is Kevin Espinosa! With a.499. It's not bad. I mean, look how fast it is. Boom, we're going into the server right now. Look at this shit. Right, right. He's dead. There's a second one. He's low. Boom. Might be a third. Ooh, grab this flechette right here. What'd you call me? Get over here, old man. Pick up this flechette. Take this right. Come right on in! Come on in, guys! Hey guys, come on in! Is that you walking around? I don't think he had anything. Hey, we're inside the building! Come on in! Is that a threat or is that a welcome? Come and find out. Is that a fucking voice box? It's just a sound board. It's just a... You're sound boarding. Right above me, Lucas. I'm friendly. I'm out here doing quests. This isn't what this game's about. Some people kill humans, some don't, you know? I'm not a human. I'm a human. I'm a human. Some people don't, you know? Like vegans. I'm a vegan for humans. I'm not a cannibal. I won't kill you or hurt you. This is all you. Get him, Doc. Reality check, huh? Reality check. Keep it running. You're a fatty. You're a fat. You're a little fat. See ya. He's a vegan for humans, man. Can you imagine Tatman playing this? God, he'd be a disaster, huh? You'd have been shot in the back already. Guaranteed. It would have happened first engagement. They would have yelled at you to get out of the way. Yeah, and then I would have got out of his way and got underneath a dropship, and then the dropship would have killed me. Wait, wait, wait. Doc, we don't want to do that. I'm a vegan. I'm a vegan. We don't want to do that. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Wait, wait, hold on. Alright, go, go, go! Wait, hold on. They're definitely not there anymore. Wait, here, guys. Yep. Oops. He's on the edge. Just wanted to say hi! We'll say hi back in a second, don't worry. Say hi back in a second, don't worry. Oh, you're lucky that glass windows. Hey, how's it going? You have a good day? I'm good. I would like all of your loot. Oh, shit. Damn it! You're not dead, are you? I'm not. I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead. You pushed in while I was talking to Fred. I see him. I see one, at least. I see one, at least. I see one, at least. I see one, at least. I see one, at least. How'd that feel? A lot of people around, right now. Two of them, two of them. Maybe three. I got two of them, I think. I got a guy right in front of me. Okay that hurt. Alright. Just... Knock it off. Okay I said knock it off. I said knock it off. Okay we're all out of meds. Jesus! Still alive huh? Alright. Nobody! Come on! Woo! And then uh... Holy shit! Oh I thought it was like a full army. I don't have any ammo for the sniper! You ain't escaping. Hello we're friendly. Got a guy talking to me. Says he's friendly. Hey where are you? Love to team up! Would love to team up! This is not the real doc. That's something the real doc would definitely do. Where are you gonna run though? I got a pistol bro I'm done. But I'm down too. Pick up your teammates gear. I'm at geothermal. Right now? He brought a pistol too. Trying to make my way to you. We've never been on this map before. Oh okay. Well you know what? I'll see you later then. Not a knife fight. I know I know I just got... Just got in a knife fight. Did you win? Yeah. Okay. Whoa! Is this spawn? Yes they've been spawning over here. Up top though this time. Yep yep. I see the pod. I do too. But he's still inside of it. No way he hasn't come out yet. Yeah yeah. No way he hasn't come out yet. Hit him once. Is he dead? Howdy! I'd hate to be one of those players that gets clapped as soon as they land. You can see his feet sticking out of the pod and then the door opens and boom headshot. Gone. Hey appreciate the games Lupo. Been a pleasure. Alright man. See ya. See ya. Doc if you had the opportunity would you go to space as Bearcat with a $3 donation? It just depends on the technology I'm in and the purpose. If it's to go up into some multi-billionaire spacecraft that has only been prototyped three times for some sort of agenda just to go up there and then come back down. But it's like I was in my backyard at one of my La Casas and there's a spacecraft with an alien species and they're going like this. I might take that offer. Thank you for watching. Watching.
