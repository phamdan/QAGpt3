I've got this huge booger in my left nostril right now, man. I really want to get it out of there. See how long you can keep it in? Alright, I'll just run with it. That's pretty good, man. I can see how a HBO series could be really good. I can see how a HBO series could be really good in this game. Or, it could be a really good show based off this game. Hopefully they don't ruin it. I think it's going to take the right director to capture the exact feel that I felt during playing this game. I think you keep it dark, dark, risky areas. I feel like the show's got to feel very risky. So, part one. So, here's my assessment. I've heard rumors that part two, they addressed some of the issues that maybe part one had. For me, most of it was... Well, actually there's two main things that popped out. Let's just start with the cons. Let's start with the cons. We know what the pros are. Let's start with the cons. Obviously, the looting aspect, it kind of took me out. Having to go over to this corner, go over here, and then press the button, and... And then manage the crafting system and all that stuff. I just didn't want to do that. It wasn't fun. That's number one. Number two, the variation of combat. There wasn't enough variety, in my opinion. I felt like after a while, all the scenarios that were being thrown in front of me, I kind of just knew. I tried to make them interesting in the sense of making them difficult. Rather than just using the brick, go find another brick, throw that one, and throw the bottle, knock this guy out, sneak up, do the sneaky, sneaky stuff. I'm not too much into it. I think there could have been a little bit more variety in the combat. And potentially variety in the people that I'm fighting. There was really only, what, three? If you think about it. You had the regular zombies, then you had the clickers, and then you had the big clickers, so that's three. And then you had the humans, which was four. And then you had the one boss guy in the building that was burning down. Four to five different creatures, and that's it. Again, this is me being nitpicky. I'm pointing out the cons. Tons of pros in the game, though. I mean, again, this is from 2013, let's not get it mistaken. The environments, the mood, the storytelling elements, whoever wrote it. I mean, pretty awesome. Gosh, it's hard to judge. Because it's 2013, I'm just trying to imagine where things were in 2013. I'd give it like an 8.6, 8.5 in terms of the year 2013. If this game came out now, let's just say it got boosted up with graphics and it looked really good. I'd go about 8 to 8.1. I think the biggest strength is the storytelling element. The bond between Joel and Ellie. How that came to be, how it played out, and how it kind of finished with the cliffhanger. That's definitely, I think, the biggest pro. That and the environments. This Friday, I think we're going to try that new game. The Quarry? Hey guys, I'm Dr. Disrespect here. I hope you enjoyed my full game playthrough of a legendary game from the year 2013 called The Last of Us. Please like the video, subscribe to the channel, commit to the Champions Club for $4.99. I'm starting seven other YouTube channels real soon, so I'll be sure to go ahead and link those. And then we can build out our empire of nothing! Hmm.
