 I See these little white boxes and the yellow boxes and hey I did it Yes, the wardle in six tries each guess must be a valid five letter word You ever tried it? I don't even know anything about it. Okay, so IST s is in the right spot eyes in the right spot. Okay, wait stop. Can I ask you what this word is? Sure Moist Never mind, I know I mean no never mind. Yeah. Yeah, dude. I got it Boy Oh my god, did I get right that what's the word spell it is mo I ST. Yeah, that's moist Right. I knew that Would I hit like me? Let me put it in a sentence that I think you don't know what it means I hit a 360 headshot snipe to win the game and the whole crowd was moist That's that's the example That's I mean that's how it's used Could have been like I got out of the pool used a towel and it was moist I like I would say damp So today I know this channel is all about violence speed and momentum and trust me There's a whole lot of it today Might be not so much Plain hide and seek Big dubs today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know I don't know how we're gonna hide when we have Tim the tap me Hey, yeah Tim go ahead and hide in that bush Five games of not shooting a weapon. It'll be interesting So we don't fire a weapon. We don't shoot. No, I'm just gonna run with my hands So that so our goal is to be the last team alive alive How is it? How do they grade the points like what's the point system based on your your team's ranking as a team if we do really well We get more points than other people. We're not technically competing against the seekers They are competing against each other and there's two separate prize pools So we're just competing against the people that are playing hide-and-seek or let that out that are hiding Um, and we just got to find good spots hide. That's why I would switch to a bushy skin and we got to find let you basically like want to stay inside the circle and Use as much cover as you can although they're probably running on a crazy low setting and shit All vehicles are banned for us Use of weapons against other players all equipment and kill streaks that do lethal damage. So maybe that means we're allowed to do Hiding players may run as well as hide. You do not need to remain stationary if you suspect you are seen All right, let's go We go north side. What do you want to do? Where are we going? Um, I don't know. I mean, uh, we should do a fucking recon, right? Let's go. Yeah It's kind of late though. We gotta go.

I'm really dropping my pen. I'm good for the rest of the game. Timmy. Take a look Where are you? I don't know where you are. That's the point. That's outside the zone like we win I need a everyone in chat do some research right now everyone Yeah, we need to open a tab figure it out because I don't know if it actually does or not I've never heard that guys. Yeah, yeah, I might be stuck. I gotta be honest. Oh god I'm coming doc. Hey, I guess that's his hiding spot for the rest of the game Z try it out. Let's see if I Oh no, doc. Oh no No, he's stuck in a bush man slippery rock right into a bush Our start could have been arguably the worst we've ever had It could you know, we talk about that again. He's stuck in a bush. I could have been here. You know what I mean? He was afk. He went to gulag I had to get a coffee operation step bro. I mean dude It said we could get a car to get him out.

I got you operation step operation step bro I'm grabbing the fucking good like other party pov of what I look like right now Yes, boom. I'm out.

They're shooting people. Hey, Tommy. Shake them up, Z, shake them up. You're gonna see some insane movement here, boys. You might wanna move. Oh my god, you got two more. Oh, you got two. Two, nice try. Nice try. Jake Zedler, Matt Zoll, welcome Marky Mark. Welcome back, six month- Hey, shut the fuck up, bro. That was my spot! Do you hear me? That was probably the most enjoyable time I've had playing Taldera since the map fucking released. Yeah, why was that so fucking fun? Alright, let's do it again. Oh. You can get lucky sometimes and get them out of chests. Oh. Oh shit. Oh my god. Fucking Tim. That was cock, bro. Are you good? I'm gonna do that? Uh. Imagine Doc would have killed the full team right there. Some shit, we'd get fucking disqualified. This is such a weird- Kill check. It's gonna be way east side. Your head is sticking out, Timmy. Yeah, Tim, you're fucking out there, buddy. Timmy, like, Lupo and I have this one locked down. Yeah. I literally don't need to move. So I don't appreciate you guys talking to me that way. Get the fuck out of the way. Far Cry 1, I feel like it's so obvious that it's not obvious. It was good. Face value. I'm never doing one of these again, champ. I mean, that was better, right? Step in the right direction. What the hell did you do, Timmy? You died first and he died again. Hey Doc, you're not doing fucking cock, okay? Literally. Can I get a check? Hey bro, pick up that ammunition box, bro. And then double stim. Let's get the gas mask and then let's double stim that. Who can't expect it with that strategy, Doc? You fucking died first, man. Lupo, let's just do better than these guys. Lupo and I will definitely out-survive you two. I mean, I put a guarantee on that. Can you imagine if this man, Doc, hot drops into a plane and just fries everyone out of the fucking sky? And then he just all F4s the tournament, bro. Dude, that'd be fucking legendary. Gas effects, but I don't think that means gas as in, as in gas, like zone gas. It's the gas grenades. I feel like you're yelling at me and I don't warrant it. Wait, what? I'm going to go. The in-fighting has already started, Doc. You're in this, Lupo. This happens on a pretty regular basis where I'm talking at such a low neutral voice of tone. And then Tim just gets so emotional. God, it's Z. You can come on over here, man. Lupo, we're going to be doing work. I am running an M4 with smokes. What's going on, guys? How are you sleeping, bro? Are you playing Tarkov? Where am I? Lupo's AFK. That's a good start for your team, Tom. Looks like we won, huh? Hey, this is not good. Feels good. It feels good. One to zero. One to zero. And that's tough, guys. I mean, the good news is this first guy's done. Look at this one guy that's going to get out of it, Doc. Look at the one guy that survived. He didn't move. He didn't move? He didn't move, Doc. One of them survived. Well, Lupo, we won that. We did. No, we did. Doc, I apologize. Yeah? Anything to say to me? Nothing. I'm jumping into solo right now so I can't concentrate. So is there one more game? I think so, yeah. Beautiful. I think we're going to win this. I'm going to go out on a limb. I'm going to do a little stamp of approval. Personalized. Certified guarantee. We're winning this one. I am being relayed some horrific information right now. What's up? There's two games left. Yeah, I was saying that a second ago. I think you were deaf and there's two games. We got game four and game five, boys. Nah. So, like, you can't... There's no reconnect. It just won't let me tab into the game. I don't know what to do. It's got me, like, semi-tabbed in. Dude, one of them just literally... Slid canceled right by me while I was laying in this bush. No way, man. Good shit. Let's go. Come on! I'm having so much fun in this tournament. Ha ha ha ha. Maybe Warzone 2. We try everyone. We try. I think, you know, if I could hang out here with it, we could be friends together. That'd be nice. At this point, I don't think it's... Ha ha! Dumb! I fucking love that. Z, I'll give you a blues harmonica when needed. Hey, hey, that was incredible. That was actually, like, that's talent right there. That's raw, like, genetics at play. Chat, I'm prone. Are you fucking dumb? Hey, Timmy, watch your goddamn mouth! I don't care about your fucking mouth. I don't care about your music, okay? I don't care, Doc. Alright, you're a streamer now. That's what you do. You don't sing. The music is playing. Ooh! Alright. Tell him to relax, man. Tell him to relax a little bit. Alright, that was kind of nice. Give me another one. The music is playing. Dice, dice, dice! Doc, cut the music! I swear to God, the Seeker literally ran right by me, dude. I swear. No! I got it. I got it. You got it? Save? I'm looking for more. You got stints? You got one? Use it. Ah! Nice try. Nice try, Timmy. I was trying to calm out without being overwhelming, dude. That was nice. Oh my God! That was a phenomenal Timmy. That was a good attempt, Timmy. That was fun, man. I think the dude just took my fucking money. Low-key bro ratios. Doc, can you do me a favor and just say L plus cringe, Timmy? Timmy, you're so L and God, a lot of cringe in you. Come on, baby! Yes, Timmy! Come on, Timmy! Keep going. People need to die, man. Hold out, Timmy. There you go. Hit that, Timmy. Love it, love it, love it. Fourth place. You just need to die. You gotta look around. You gotta look around for some Timmy's. Ah! Yes! Another one! No! No! Dude, that was so... That was good, Timmy. Back-to-back games? Well, gentlemen... What a day. Honest to God, I really did have fun with that. That was a lot of fun. I had a great time. That was a good time. Big W. Four or five hours, didn't fire a single bullet. I had a great time.
