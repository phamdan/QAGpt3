And all of them were kind of, I mean, we had some contrast, some variation in our little collection that I take into the tub. And then basically, I create a story the whole time while I'm in the bath. And basically, I'd find the hero guy, and he and he'd fight guys going all the way around the tub on the edge. And with each person he'd fight, they get harder. And each one has their own like abilities or whatever, right. And then obviously, you're making your way all the way around to fight the boss. And I absolutely loved it. Anyways, you put a lot of like, you know, Hey, what are you doing? I don't know, what's your problem? I'm trying to get to so and so whatever, right? You can't defeat me.
