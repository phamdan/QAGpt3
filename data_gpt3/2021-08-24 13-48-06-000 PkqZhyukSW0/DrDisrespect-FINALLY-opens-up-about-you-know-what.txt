 I make probably a fourth, a quarter of what I was making on Twitch. A year later from being banned from the platform, you know, a lot of people think, hey Doc, you did good. You're doing, you're incredible. I listen. We've we've certainly tried to maximize the most of what we have to work with. And that's certainly been the case, champs, and I appreciate the support. You guys have just been absolutely amazing. Um, with the Twitch ban is really how it's really affected us, not just from a financial standpoint, but from a from a networking standpoint, from all the relationships we've built over the past five years in terms of Activision and EA. I mean, everyone, all the big sponsors, all the big partnerships, they have to question, why did you get banned? Right. So our ultimate bigger building out of the umbrella and the Doc universe and everything, whether it's obvious or not, the blacklisting, the shadow banning, it's happening. And, um, and as well as you think we're doing, and I think we again, we're doing well enough. I'll tell you, man, it's been extremely disheartening. It's been it's been a roller coaster of emotion, and it's absolutely fucking sucks. And to and to end off my little discussion here. But a lot of people ask me, do you know the reason? Yeah, I do know the reason why now. I've known for months now the reason why. And I'll just say this right now, champs. There's a reason why. We're suing the fuck out of them, OK? I don't know how else to put it. The amount of damages and you just don't. No, no. Um. Champs, what's the first thing you see when you type the name in on Google? What's the first thing you see? Yeah, you see two time international video gaming superstore of allah, allah, allah, allah, allah. You see Lamborghini, I get it. But you also see Dr. Ban from Twitch. No reason why. Um. Do you think? You think a big time company like Nike is going to want to work with that big question mark? Or Disney? It fucking sucks. It really fucking sucks. I don't know how else to put it, man. It's affected us in so many different ways. And I've just been in a... We stay focused in. We stay fucking dominant. All the little speed bumps. Good evening, Champions Club. We're on our way to the arena, but, uh, Dr. Disrespect. It's making a little pit stop. And yes, it does involve diarrhea. I got one quarter, champs. One, uno. And alls we're looking to do. Wins. Pick it up! Choco! You only get one shot. This fucking guy right here. This guy right here. This guy right here. This fucking guy right here. You only get one shot. You only get one shot, baby. If I could just see this guy. I'd be going. Good night! Woo! You're looking at somebody over here. Champs, it's not a five. Come on. Not a five. I don't know what you guys are talking about. Right here. Right here. Right here. There you go. Right here. Right here. Right here. Right here. Right here. Right here. Right here. Right here. Right here. Oh, I need this right here. Champions Club. We did exactly what we expected to do. We used the one quarter in the back pocket. Push it into the arcade machine. Pressed start. And walked away feeling like the biggest hot shot that arcade has ever seen. Now I'm jumping into the Lamborghini Diablo VT. I'll see you at the arena. How long have you been there? Watch and learn. Wow, this is awkward. See ya. Z, no slide canceling. That's fine. I got a couple of triple kills right here. You're playing against botsy. Oh, am I? Am I actually playing these bots? Am I just breaking my heart right now? I don't want to tell you. I think these are real players. No, it's bots for like first 20 games. Those are real players. No, it's a real player. I'm not sure if I'm playing against bots. No, it's all bots for the first 25 games. But I've played the game before, I think. So would it still have any bots against me? All I'm saying is, just not get ahead of yourself. Well, I mean, they have names that look like... I mean, you know, okay. Are these bots that we're playing? The booty shake emo. Let's take a look. Zlaner, my model. Aim assist. Aim assist. Just let it take over your body. Little aim assist. Hey Z, you gotta write a song on aim assist. I probably should, huh? Yeah, I think it'd be a hit. I bet you it would be. That's not even a question. Doc Records? Is that the name of the production company? No, I'd probably come up with something a little bit more than that. You know, maybe like Doctor Disrespect Records. Okay, Doctor... I like that. I just thought Doc Records. Doc Records? Come on, man. It just kind of slides off the tongue. There's just so many Docs in the world though, man. You just can't get away with a nickname Doc. This is the two-time. Yeah, the back-to-back. The sound, that's my Lamborghini Diablo VT. It's not a kit car. It's the real deal. SNAP BOMB! Stop calling me. I'm in the middle of my outro. Ignore! A hint of fucking violence. A hint of fucking speed. A hint of momentum. It's just unbelievable! I think there's a turtle! Juice Van O, thank you for the five and Super Chat Doc. It's my 37th Feliz Navidad on Saturday. Will be camping. Can I get a birthday? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
