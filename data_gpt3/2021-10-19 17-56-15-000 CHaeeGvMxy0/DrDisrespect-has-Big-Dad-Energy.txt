I had an incredible dream last night. I gotta tell you about this champs. I, for whatever reason, like I came across running into Denzel Washington, okay. I really liked it. Like he's, you know, he's one of the all-time classic actors, right. Anyways, it was just such a casual meeting and all of a sudden, it went from Denzel Washington to one of my all-time favorites growing up, Magic Johnson. And the whole dream from it, like the Denzel Washington part was fast, but how it switched to Magic Johnson. I had Magic Johnson the entire dream. He showed me his, like we were talking stories about 80s basketball business. I mean, it was a full complete dream champs. We're like at his place. He showed me all his memorabilia. He's telling me stories about this and this as if like, as if we're just sipping on a black steel bourbon, you know, what a dream. I wanted to let you know, I finally got my first solo war zone. Went after trying for almost two years, but I got zero kills and everyone else just died to the gas. Does it still count? Says Cindy Harman with a 1999.
