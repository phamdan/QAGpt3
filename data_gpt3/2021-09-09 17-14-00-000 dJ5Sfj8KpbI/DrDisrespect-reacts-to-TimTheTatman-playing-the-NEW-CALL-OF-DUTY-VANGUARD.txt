 For your first look at live gameplay from Call of Duty Vanguard core multiplayer, tune in now to one of your favorite creators. Oh Timmy, come here Timmy! Oh Timmy. Uhhhh... Let's check out the gameplay Timmy. Hahaha! Haha! Wait. I'm against him?! Oh fuck. Who? Who are you afraid of Timmy? Please don't tell me it's Swag that he's afraid of. I'd bury Swag in a multiplayer game. I'd cut him down so fast. I would. Okay, immediately my sensitivity is off. Tell us about the game though Tim. We don't care about your key bindings and your sensitivity. Please just don't mention it again. Thanks. How do I throw my grenades? Wow, that was kind of bigger than I thought. I agree. Jesus, you can't see this guy? Because I can't. Swag's playing with like, he's got... I got... Don't talk to me, shut up. Step up! You gotta get rid of this weapon. I mean the rate of fire... I... Jesus, you're 2 and 11. Timmy? Where are my guys? My guys... Are we here? Guys? I want to try the bar though. First game. Alright, I'll respect it. Where can they come from? Mini-map. Check the mini-map. I'm getting more people now too, which is good. You hear him? You hear him? Is someone under me? Yeah, yeah. Got him. Hell yeah. Hold on to him! Shit on the bitch. I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna get him. Shit on the bitch. Okay, that was toxic. Okay, I deserve that. We're falling behind! Hey! Hey! You fuck off, swag! You know what Tim the Tatman's next video is gonna be? I bodied swag. And we all know. You'd be lying. Jesus! You're not doing shit, Timmy. I just realized... Timmy, I think your KD is less than one. Fuck it, just for the record. It's just him and I on a team against swag and repulse. Oh my god, do you see... Do you see... Do you hear him? How many times champs? It's not fair. What do you mean it's not fair? Wake up! Come on, Timmy! Let's go! It's not fair. You're winning! I will not stand for it. Boom! There you go. Shit on the swag, bitch. Don't stay in the same spot. He's gonna know exactly where you're at. Okay. There you go. I just come from... Hey, Chad, I just spawned there, right? You didn't check the beach. There you go, baby! Let's get loose! There you go! Okay. Yeah, yeah. I mean, a little triple kill from Tim and Tatman, ladies and gentlemen. Uh-huh. Oh, god. I mean, I've always loved the Thompson, bro. I mean, when it comes to like... Immediately already feeling good about the Thompson and puts it on the Thompson. Got it. Oh, my fuck! Double kill! It's an interesting map design. I'm trying to see the layout of this map or understand it. Double kill. Of course. Hey, TeeP, can you fuck off, bro? Like I'd be doing so wet. Like he's killed me. Every single time. TeeP has killed you 20 times in a row, Timmy. This game... It looks fun, you know? Like the multiplayer looks fun. Like I'd grind it out for a little bit. You know... I got my death machine again. I gotta take this kill for y'all because I swear, it sound like it's my dog. Jesus. She's guilty me. I gotta take off this site. You've gotta do something. These teams are fucking shocked, bro. Jesus, no belief in your skill or your teammates. And it's documented. Looks like you can go right through here. We'd love for you to break down the new Warzone map and get your thoughts, says DJ Vaughn with a $3 donation. Believe it or not, champs, I only heard that there was a new Warzone map revealed. I haven't seen anything on it. My reaction today to it, it's the first thing you'll see. The next chapter of Warzone. There it is. I'm Amos Hodge, Associate Creative Director at Raven Software. With the launch of Vanguard, we want to ensure that the feel and character of the game extends beyond... I don't think he likes me. I'm not sure Raven likes the two time over there. Into Call of Duty Warzone. I am pleased to announce that there is a brand new Warzone map coming this year, shortly after the launch of Vanguard. And we are going to the Pacific, featuring an entirely new... So Raven is confirming that they're taking over... They'll continue to support and take over the Battle Royale portion of Call of Duty. Damn....new play space, complete with all new points of interest. Players will get to traverse the lush landscapes of the... All right, fully own it, take it to the next level. I'm on board. The goal was to create a fresh new experience for Call of Duty players by breaking out of the war torn world of the dance. Yes, please, let's get the hell out of that map. To create an atmosphere that is vibrant. Nice. I like this. Alive. Definitely feels like a PUBG map though. As far as visuals and technology, Warzone Pacific will share the same tech and engine as Call of Duty Vanguard. Warzone Pacific. This allows for seamless weapon integration and play balance. We look forward to playing with all of you later this year when the Pacific officially comes online. I mean, how big is this map? Have they said how big it is? Is it the same size as Warzone? I like the view distance, how that feels. You know, if you could just imagine someone... Tonight. Oh, hey. Greg. Welcome to the multiplayer reveal. Greg. That's Greg. Greg's the one that showed me how to use Radiant. I'm Greg Reistorf, the multiplayer creative. Yeah. It's all about that player creativity. Matt. Matt Abbott, baby. There he is. Becoming a little more creative about what you want to do. One of my all time favorites right there, man. It's good to see these guys are doing well. It really is. Who's the guy on the left? He hasn't said anything yet. I feel like he might be a little nervous. He's waiting. Lookit, he's like, are you gonna finish yet, Greg? Like it was always supposed to be there. What about the other guy? Map over time. That's right. Like the state that the map starts at is gonna look different than the state that it ends at. Is he like a bad guy? Is he gonna take down Greg and then like him and Matt are gonna have this huge battle inside this house? Like what? I don't know what's going on. It's like the idea of combat pacing. You gotta take them out right now, Matt. And then you gotta take them down. I don't trust them. Every playlist that you're going into. Watch out! And those modes even. Oh, man. It's not just visual either. Increasing the caliber does increase the damage of the bullet does. So we're kind of moving away from this. I was expecting a different voice. I was expecting this heavy like Croatian accent or something. I don't know. Hey, Doctor, do you play any any video games on your channel? And Doctor, do you play any video games? When are you going to start playing video games? I didn't come here to see you talk. I didn't come here to see you talk. Oh, no, that's not what I'm about. I'm about watching you playing video games. Come on, bro. I didn't I didn't skip school for nothing. Come on, bro. I didn't skip school for nothing.
