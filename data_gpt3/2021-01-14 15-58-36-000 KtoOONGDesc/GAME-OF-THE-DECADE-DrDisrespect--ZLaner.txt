 Now we're into a trios game, ladies and gentlemen. Things get a little bit more difficult. More areas to be shot from, more angles, more players and bodies to worry about. But more importantly, more little peekers behind the trees, behind the buildings. One peek. All right, baby. There we go. Battle Royale! Gonna land lower, right below you on this section. Couple guys, just one in the front door. Guy flying in. I see him, I see him, I see him. I body him. He's dead. Two teams below me. I'm in. Second floor review, Doc. I can't get by him! Behind me. Broke him. Ah, what a loser. I think he might be muted. Hey! How you doing? Hey! I heard you loud and clear though, Doc. I see this guy right here. Oh. This guy might just go right through my Claymore. Hey, here on me. Yeah, he went through the Claymore. Good night. He's in the upper channels. He's in the far room, one shot. We almost have enough for loady. Alright, let's get it. We got enough. I'll, uh, pull the trophy on. Okay, sounds good. If you cruise over this way, I'm already legging it over. I got a helicopter we can go grab after as well. I may have missed that trophy. Being tracked by an enemy team, stay sharp. I see one on top of corner. Three, all three on top corner. I'm about to snipe. Knocked. Get on the crack. Oh. Please pick one, here you go. Finish one, finish one. Okay. I'm just going to go over and crush them with my heli. Got one. Yep. Another one's inside here. Over here in the field, over here in the field, Doc. On our left, on our left. One knocked, dead. Two knocked. All knocked. Yeah, this might be a bot lobby, I don't know. Doc, I might push a little harder this game if that's okay with you. Knocked one. I see, I don't, I don't. I got knocked, knocked. All dead. See it. Woo. Guy on screen doing a mission. Oh, baby. He's gone. He said what? He didn't even know what happened. Hit him. What did? Uh, moving right here. Broke that guy. I knocked him. He's right under the red, like, top of the matters. Up higher too on the mountain. Oh, and another one way out. Yeah, I see that. Knocked that guy. Holy shit. Oh man, the snipes knocked. Oh, knocked the other one by the red. Oh buddy, this game is something else. I'm stunned. Got him. Last one's up on the hill. Oh, I'm getting shot up on the left here. Somewhere at 150. On him right. Hit him once. Hit him again. Love that. Love that. I almost wanted to get rid of the weapon. Hit him again. I'm just tired of fucking hit markers at this thing. Felt like that was a headshot too. I can tap you. I can tap you. His teammate's going to be back up on the hill where we got the other ones. There was a guy on top of the helicopter. Yeah. Two of them. Two of them. I might just go out there.

Z, would you let me do my damn thing? I know, I know, I know. Oh my goodness. Doctor, listen, I'm only looking out for your best interest. I didn't know that your IQ is so high that you knew that the airstrike was gonna go on a left trajectory instead of straight on you. You know what I'm saying? I don't know these things. I'm learning, I'm learning. Beautiful play by the way, it was fantastic. Just teasing. Yeah, yeah. They're on top of the roof. Above you? Yep. Doc, I might just have to lay back on their loot, hold on. Give them the love. Broke it, broke it, broke it. All these guys gotta come out, huh? Is that the right guy? That's the right guy. Who's the guy you're shooting at? I am. Right here? Yeah. Oh my god, Doc. Come on now. Doc, one on the left side, shooting at me, I got him. Oh my god, Doc, come on now. The guy right in front of me? Which guy? The other one on the left. Another one on the left side. Yeah, hit him right in the face, just a white shield, nothing much. Where you going? Oh man, oh man. Where's he going? I don't know where he's going, Doc, I'm getting a cell for us. You know what, that's not a bad idea. I'm gonna get a little, you know, same thing. Vehicle. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got him. Just, wow. Hit him once, blue shielded. I'm dead. Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. You got it right? I'm good, I'm good. Get him out, get him out. Wanted to make sure. Someone else just landed far out, like 10. This guy's in the yellow window. Bye. You know I got your back, Doc, come on now. Come on now, let's lock this one up, huh? Easy. Vehicle two, vehicle right. Right here, right here on the left.

No, they're all just slithering here, Doc. They're all just laying down RPGs. He's rushing, he's rushing. Come on. One more shot. Went to the right. Oh my gosh. The guy back there, the guy behind you had a little bit of money. Yeah. But you don't have anywhere to rest, it's fine. Let's shut up, baby. One v two. One v two? Look at that. Slitherer. In the house. Most likely gonna have to push out to you. Backside. They gotta push up, they gotta push up. Look at him. Oh my God, Doc. Come on, Doc. I mean, like, what do you do against that? Huh, Z? I don't know, baby. Let's go now. Let's go, Doc. Boom. One at a time, one at a time. You fucking suck, you dick sucker. I'll slap you right in your face. Ladies and gentlemen, these guys ain't even close. I mean, they're not even close to our level. Trust me, they're all five foot one. Right, they're all playing in their mommy's house at their apartment complex, right? In a pool that they can't swim in because they never heat it. Champions Club, whatever you do, don't go to SBMM.com and check out the kill death ratios of all the teams that were in that lobby because you might be shocked to know that we actually just interrupted a pro tournament and we got involved side by side. Z laner sprinting to the finish line. We got the job done. That's checkmark number two on the triple threat sniper challenge today. A duo win already. A trio win secured.
