 Wordle warm-up. Yes, it's tradition. If we're gonna play with Timmy, we always start the day off with Wordle. And that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Okay. Chat closed down. Today? You know what we have to really do? We have to create opportunity. We have to cream the competition. Oh, we got to see the first letter, huh? Okay. C-c-c-clone. Clone. Actually, I'm just putting the, I'm just, it's just part of my, my, I'm You, you, what you can, you do. My, I'm taking you through the mind of the doc, right? I'm putting the E right here. These are just temporary letters just to fill in the gap so then I could see the word with a C right here and an E right here and then we could fill in these letters, right? And what it does, it creates opportunity to create the visual sort of, you know, breakdown of what this word can be. C-c-c-clone. I don't think E goes right there. I think E's the second letter. I'm gonna have to be honest. C-c-c-clone. We're going back to here. We're going right here. Cheer. Cheer. No, it can't be because then I don't have it. I'm just, you know what, I don't care if I'm wasting. I'm not really, damn, it would be nice to guess it on the third letter, third word though, huh? That's kind of what I'm going for. I want to guess it on the third try. Anything past three, it does, it's like, eh, whatever. But if you can get the word in the top three, that's where the money is. Shire. Sheep. Seer. Cern. Cern. Cern. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Set. Seagate. Seff. Seffle. Seast. Seeder. We're already used to an A and an R, so all I'd be doing is C-C. The hell's going on, man? Maybe doing wordle in the beginning is harder than it is at the end. Not, well, I'm not awake yet. The brain's not activated right now. Chill. Chill. Chill. What the hell? C-H. I don't know. I'm just making up a word now. Sci-tech. Kind of a sick name. I mean, if you really look at it, the letter that follows a C could either be H or Y or U or I. I haven't really thought about U. Why is this one destroying my mind? This one's just a... Alright. I know I already used the word, but I feel like I have two more options, you know? Let me just, let me feel it out. Holy ****. Okay. Sciv-sivet. Sivet. Sivem. Sivem. Siveb. Siveb. Uh. Cop-copper? Copper? Copen. Copen. Copen. Copen. Copen. Cop-copy. Copy. Sive-siver? Siver? I don't know if it's a C-H. Because then I have to go C-H. Because I can't put a U-E-R. Or U-E. There's nothing else that would follow the H. The Y's gone. Sci-uh, sci-word. I can't even think of a word. Sci-I am. I am. I'm too. I'm. Okay, focus up. Sci-sire. Sire. Sci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci-ci. Cheeb! Whoa. Holy ****. Asked Tim to play Wirtle today. Yeah. Is he on? Tell him to fire I wanna watch him, I wanna spectate. Hey guys, Doctor Disrespect here. Today we're gonna be spectating Timmy playing Wirtle. Ha ha ha ha. Doc says Wirtle, it's Chief, you're a fucking idiot. Doc, I'm on a thing right now, bro. I'm on a thing, right? It's fucking Chief, are you stupid? Shit dude, this fucking guy literally making me stop my fucking tangent here so I can show him that he's fucking stupid. Extremely good Warzone players, man. Thank you, Timmy. Appreciate it. And there's also extremely good Call of Duty CDL pros. Right? I choose to stream, but I get it. One thing that I gotta give a point to the CDL on and CDL pros, this man's scumpy. What about him? You know, I feel like no one, you know, I've seen a lot of people going back before talking about it, but at the end of the day, this guy Scump, who is like the godfather of competitive Call of Duty, and he's playing with me and Methods in the World Series of Warzone this year. Scump came off of not playing Warzone, hopped in and won the $100,000 solo thing, right? Okay, so where are you going with this fucking story, Timmy? So I mean, that in itself, it's like, scumpy CDL pro came into a Warzone tournament and won. So it's like, you have to give some level of credit to CDL there because it already, you know, Doc, Doc, you're fucking stupid. I already did this. Wurtle is chief. You're fucking dumb. Look, I don't know. I don't know why this took you so long, to be honest with you. Like, no bullshit, Doc. Before I went live, I was watching you a little bit and I was sitting there and I was like, this is, I literally was like, it is painful how slow this is going. That was a literal thought I had. And yeah, dude, you know what I mean, Doc? And Doc, I'm on like a tangent right now. Just give me a minute, man. I'm on a tangent. Doc, I have no caloric intake yet today. Crazy. I'm gonna, like, I'm doing the fasting bullshit. So I'm like, I'm getting ready here in a minute, but I just wanna, you know what I mean? So, okay. Was my Wurtle that bad? Is it, was it really that bad? Was it really that bad? Yes, yes. It was pretty bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, it was. Yes. Yes, yes. So yeah. That's it. That's it. Low key, bro, hey. I'm gonna keep it stacked with you, bro. I forgot about that. Keep it, keep it a stack. Low key, bro. Keep it a stack, stack, dub. I'm telling you, Timmy, Timmy should have a list in the corner of his stream with his top five words that he says. Obvious, bro, W, low key, keep it a stack. And we need one more. Thoughts, thoughts? Yeah, the thoughts and then the sniff. Actual, chalked, no cap, chalk, no shot. That's another one. That's a big one. That's a big one, no shot. Anyways, he should have like all his sayings in the corner and then WIP should just, should manually manage how many times he says it in a stream. Like that.
