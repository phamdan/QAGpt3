 What do you think of this? Oh no way, if you do this I'm gonna give you a million dollars. Oh yeah! Oh my god! Oh my god! You're gonna have to give me some time. With my bank. I gotta transfer some money around. Holy **** you just hit that. He's down low on your left. Think he's resin? Other guys, other guys right there next to you. Nice, last guy's right down low. Where you killed the first guy. Oh my god. On the right side. Oh my god! Oh my god! Get it up on the Twitter feed. Come on baby, come on baby. One at a time baby! They were really cracked out of their mind too Z. Oh my god. It makes so much sense to go World War II fiction. Uh, boring! Boring. It makes so much sense to have jet fighter planes flying above. **** I can't get out! It makes so much sense to fight in a jungle. The guy moving through the forest pushing to your left side. Try to head glitch the head, uh, try to head glitch the **** rock John! Ha ha! It makes so much sense that you need to own Vanguard. Go there. Thank god. It makes so much sense that the audio's making me **** go deaf. **** loud, it's **** loud! Boring! It makes so much sense to bring back Dead Silence. The perk everyone loved. It makes so much sense that every single weapon that I pick up doesn't kill him. I still **** lose! It makes so much sense to have a whole bunch of rocks that I can't climb. Ha ha! It makes so much sense to have audio on my parachute and then no audio when I cut it and then no audio when I deploy my parachute. Game crashed? I am, uh, I'm about to uninstall this game. It makes so much sense. I gotta... What the **** are you? Can't hear anything, jam! Ehhhhhh! No! How do I **** lose that? How do I lose? How do I lose that? Oh my god, this game's so **** cheesy! **** game sucks! To me it makes sense. To me, there is a need for a new game, for a new experience. Something **** dominant, skillful, high tech, futuristic, next generation. It's only a matter of time. It all makes sense. It all makes sense. I'm here, I'm here! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! It all makes sense. Oh! I had to get motivated. I mean, even though it was like a... That hyped me up. I'm putting that music in the background. I kinda went with a dramatic approach. Dude, I loved it! We're not... Okay. Okay, he jumped off. Going like this. Lighting this guy on fire. I lighted my fire. BOOM! Oh! What do you mean it actually worked, Timmy? Come on, man! Got a little trim. Looks like a bowl cut. You guys are real nice. I mean, imagine if I went to your house, and you just got a haircut. And I knocked on your door, and you open that door up, and I just start talking about how bad your hair is. Watch your **** mouth when you're talking to the two-ton. Doctor looks like Joe Exotic. Man, I love reading chat. Hey, nice bangs, Matilda. Helen Keller give you a deal on that cut, says Neo Geo with a cut out of five. What happened to Doc's hair? I don't know. What happened to your teeth? Stop reading the donut stock. They're not worth it. I have Twitter open right now, and it just caught the corner of my eye. Let me bring it up. Yeah, what are we looking at? What the hell do you think we're looking at? What the hell do you think we're looking at? Oh, ****. I don't know what we're looking at, Doc. What did I drop right here? Oh. Holy ****. No, man. Oh, no. Oh, no. They're shooting me through the **** thing right here too. Where are you? Oh, look where they **** are. I know, man. Oh, my God. They're coming from like right over here. Oh, dude, they are ****. He is got the premium package. He's got the **** premium package, man. Right over there. I didn't even peek. He's already pre-firing it. I got plates. He's on my, outside my building. Okay, I got him. It's **** locked on even through that. Oh, my God. I got him one shot. **** dirty hacker. **** stain. Literal **** stain. Level 21. Look at him looking at me through the wall. And then... 26 kills. 26 kills. We'd love for this guy to get banned somehow. Like right now. Right now. You need to message Tim. Message Wips. I'm going to message Wips. I'm going to message Wips. See if we can get him banned live. Get him out of here. A-step. Look at this. So, is Ricochet live? No. It's live in... It's live in... Asia. Why not North Americana? I think that's a phenomenal question that everyone in the community is asking right now. Really? What's this guy's teammates? He only has two kills. Hell's bells. Gosh, you're really good. Thank you. I've been playing a long time. Yeah, I only have two kills. Well, you just gotta get pretty good, kid. I just sent Wips a nice message. Let's see if he can get the button on the line. This is... This is the premium package. This is one of the best I've seen. This is the premium package. It's almost like there's magnetic bullets too. He's probably got everything, man. Oh my god, he got binned! We got a bin! Let's go! He's gone? Let's go! Oh, see ya! We are the anti-cheat, doc. We are Ricochet. Poor Hell's Bells, though. Oh, Hell's Bells is now in A. He doesn't have his cheater buddy to help him out in the lake. Oh my god. I got one! And notice how they just fall apart. Noa Swift, thank you for the $5 donation. Doc, I need a lesson in sniping in this game. Says Noa Swift of the Five. Just close your eyes, breathe in, open your eyes, look to the left, and do a no-look snipe. Trust me, it works almost every time. How do I get an amazing mustache like yours, doc? Says Don De Lejon. With a $20 donation, you know what you do? You travel to Ethiopia. You go out and... I'm telling you, you go out there, even if you have to look for days at a time, dehydrated out of your mind, the nutrition level is non-existent. I need you on the verge of dying. Because that's the only way it's going to attach itself to your face. It knows. You just gotta look. Doc, this game would slap if we had grapple hooks like in Blackout. I make traversing the new terrain more fun and add a new dynamic to the game. Says Wizard with the $4.90 donation. I'm going to be a little bit more of a snipe-o-sniper. The new dynamic to the game says Wizard with the $4.99. I think they have to do it. If they're going to keep this map, I feel like they have to have the grapple hooks from Blackout. At least a similar mechanic. Maybe even a more polished mechanic. Maybe it's a secondary or maybe it's a tactical slot. Everyone would use it. I think it'd be a good variation to throw in there. You pick a grapple hook that's got a cool... Use three or four of them, and then you throw it in the air. Got one knocked, the other one's low. Fuck out of my game. Oh, let's go.
