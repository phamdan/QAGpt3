You guys ever see this one? He hits him anywhere, but it hits him in the head. He can shoot anywhere, but it's hitting him in the head. It's called magnetic bullets, chap. That's why it doesn't look like it locks on. It looks natural, but it looks natural, but everything's a headshot and it doesn't matter where he shoots him. He's going to, he's going to kill him. Watch. So it doesn't look like a traditional aim bot. This is good. This is a good learning lesson, I think, for everybody. Uh oh. Does he hear him? Is he here? Headshots. See that? But he was aiming at his foot. Wait a minute. Hold on. He's going to die. Hold on. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Oh! We're not even looking at him. This is called magnetic bullets, chap. Oh.
