 Break the glass. Message received. It's kind of nice not having Alex in the command center. It's been nice and quiet. I'd like to beat the game and then maybe we get him out. Ladies and gentlemen, the grand finale of Resident Evil Village. Here we go. Jesus Duke, take it easy man. Please do take a look at my new stock. Oh, we will. We will Duke. Let's get some ammo Duke. Wait a minute. He's still sold out? Examine. All right. Boom and get up. Find the way out. Brother Miranda brought me five peoples from the village like I asked. I put them to sleep with some liquid in and I put Cthulhu in their tummies. I worked them a second a cloudy day. All the people from the village are dead this morning. One is almost a lichen. I filled again. Mother wants strong vessels but I cannot get any. Jesus. I thought we already killed this thing. I guess I gotta do this. Any pipe bumps? There it is. I thought I was gonna like skip across the water. I don't have anything to really like threaten this thing with. No! There's our gate. We know. You're bitter off than I thought. Who's that? There's a stronghold not too far outside the village. Go there and get my flask. Do that and you pass. Self-centered prick. Yeah. I could have done the voiceover self-centered prick. I'd have been dock in this situation. The voiceover would have been way better. I'm fucking trapped right now. Lost. I'm gonna use that sixth wing key to open. I'll be right back. I got I got. I was trying to delay it but I got diarrhea. I'll be right back. You gotta get crazier than them. There it is. Man. Can I see what the damage is on this thing? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Let's bring out the big boy. This thing packs a punch, doesn't it? Duke how are you faster than me? No, no, no. Don't worry about it. I'm just looking for some ammo. Hey, you finally got ammo back, man. The show must go on. Good luck. Oh, that's see now I thought that I thought there was a just a shadow standing in the middle of the staircase walking towards me at a fast pace. Not spatial worlds for design but for. What are we talking about? Come here. No, no, no. Get me out of here. Just set it down right here. That's perfect. All right, just like that. That easy champ. That easy. That's how you do it champ. Okay. There's a formula to everything. How do I get this door open? This is what. How do I get this fucking door open? I mean, it's a completely different level, right? Not this guy. No. No. Eat shit. All right, easy. The hell was that? The hell was that? There's our fourth one. Lady Miranda. You're the real deal, Ethan. Well done. First of all, come to me. Put all the flasks in the altar and I'm sure you'll figure the rest out. See you, Ethan. Crystal school. Very valuable. Crystal hammer. Very valuable. Giant crystal axel. Speaking of Alex, let's go check him out, man. Alex, are you in there? Poor guy's waiting for me to break him out or something. I. There he is. Oh, Alex, come on. Just use your head. Head butt. Come on. Head butt. What's that? Yeah, once I finish the game, I'll get you out. Find Heisenberg. What's going on? Pattern looks familiar. Yes. Welcome. Welcome. Where am I going? No, no, no, no. Here at Disneyland Parks, there's nothing to be afraid of, children. It's just a scary, haunted hotel. If you do feel you're feared, please find your parents and make your way to the exit aisle. If the machine. That is the end of our tour. Good luck. Don't worry about the kid, Ethan. It'll be fine. Just get your ass across the bridge. And they're off. It's lettuces ahead, tomato trying to catch up, bubblegum sticking to the rail, and toilet paper wiping up the trail. Trail. What the hell? Mia? Truth hurts, don't it? There you are, man. I'm back. Take a seat. Lady, super-sized bitch. Ugly as a psychodile. And then run like a freak. Is this Nicolas Cage talking? Don't you get it. Stay out of my way. Oh, we'll be seeing you. This guy again. 90 minutes gonna be tight. I know, I got 90 minutes, champs. Hey, ready? Easy. This guy, there's no way I'm losing a fight against this guy. This can't be the end for me. I must kill her. It's like a, you know when you're a kid and you had like all your G.I. Joes or your little army guys, whatever, you know, the toys that you're playing with. You need to create little stories. I feel like that's what I'm playing right now. Ethan, I heard explosions. What the hell happened? You know? I'm gonna find Miranda and get Rose back. Not without me. It's too dangerous. Wait there, you hear me? Ethan? Rose? Mia? With Heisenberg gone, you've lost your lead. What are you going to do? Even when I took Mia's place in your home. Poor Ethan. Who are you? Where's Rose? There she is. Is this it? And we did it, champs. Just like that. That can't be the end. That was a tutorial? We just, we finished the tutorial, ladies and gentlemen. God damn it. When does it end? Terminate Miranda and rescue Rose. I've located the Megamycete. And two explosives armed. I'm going in. Show me your hands. God damn, it really is you. Where is my husband? Where is my daughter? I couldn't save him, but I can save Rose. You thought he was dead. You were always dead. You didn't think it was weird. No matter how much you got hurt. Remember? Three years ago, we were murdered by Jack. Your whole body is nothing but mold. I will save Rose. To be honest, I have no idea what's going on. Just squeeze through there. Jump into it. This is it. Let me get that beautiful whisper of... Sasha! I've missed you. Hey. Look at me when you're talking. There you go. I will take what is due. Rose is mine! What the fuck? We did it! You're... dead. My evil! We did it. Little Rose. Gotta use block, Doc. Didn't use block one time in this game, champs. We gotta move. I forgot Alex is still trapped behind the glass, champs. It's about to chill out. Go, take us up now! Where is Ethan? Ethan was... Now Ethan's dead. That was Ethan right there. That was Ethan. Woo! Yeah! Ah, Champions Club. Another single player experience completed. Boy oh boy did we look good. We dominated. We grabbed them, snapped them. We weren't even scared. This game... Alex! I think it's time we get Alex out of here, huh? Alex! My first time ever playing Resident Evil, champs. I wanna have some fun! I hope you're down here! Ah, Jesus! Bullets cannot harm... But the light can! You have your daughter right in your own hands. What? You turned her into... honey? Ahhhhh! Together, Mother Miranda won't stand a chance. You
