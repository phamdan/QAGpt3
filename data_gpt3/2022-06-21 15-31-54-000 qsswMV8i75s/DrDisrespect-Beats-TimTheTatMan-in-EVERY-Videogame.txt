 Ahhhhhhh! Oh! What the hell? Listen champs, we're playing alongside Timmy the tornado......tenders. Today's one of those days. Come on! I think it's time we get serious, huh? I think it's time we get real serious. It says on the note what you just said. I don't know either! And it doesn't matter. And here is the pain that knows it. I'm not gonna be myself, so... Yeah, you gonna win that? Come on now. Like, I'm not gonna be pushed around when I say that. I'm not here to get pushed around. Tactical? Yeah? My fucking god, dude! You ain't nothing! Fuck, dude. I got the whole fucking lobby staring at me. Fucking A, dude. Jesus, Timmy. Get down here, Timmy! Holy shit! Only two left! I knocked one! Oh god, man. You just land... If you just jump... Your decision making is not there. There's not... Let's stay here. I'm getting shot from outside? Shot from outside? What does that even mean? They're sitting above us because there's a team holding us top-peak. Even if we kill them, we gotta get rid of them. Right? You mean top-peak? You mean all the way up the mountain? I just... Yeah, all the way up the mountain. So what are we doing flying the helicopter down the mountain, Timmy? I was trying to chop the guys and then they ran in on you. You were doing anything. I was flying. Exactly, man. It's just like a bad... It's deja vu from a... I don't know, from a tournament. You just don't want to jump out of the truck. You don't want to jump out of the helicopter. What's next, Timmy? Just win your 1v2. I mean, that's really what it comes down to. I mean, I'm going in there thinking like, boom, we're about to clean this up. There's only two guys left, right? You don't see me flying around on the minimap. You don't see me flying. No decision making with that. You're just like... That is true. That is true. I definitely overestimated you. I'll hide again, huh, Doc? Just say, fuck it? I'm not. Not this time. You're gonna deal with it. I'm not. You left! I did. Doc! Come on, man! What do you mean? What do you mean, Timmy? They don't stop coming in. I don't want to start like that. I invited you. I'm gonna put my mic... Get the hell out of the way then, Alex! Hey, listen. If you're not gonna do it, right? If you're not gonna do it, I'll do it. Excuse me for a moment. I'll put my mic here. I gotta do everything around here, champs. I really do. Why don't you host since no one plays on the west coast? Everyone's working on their tan. Everyone's driving their convertible. It's 95 and sunny in Florida today, but yeah, sure, I'll host. Yeah, but there's no waves in Florida. That's the problem. We're the Sunshine State, okay? Yeah, but there's nothing to do in Florida other than like... Be at the ocean. Right? Parasailing and shit? You can go to the ocean, you can go to the video games and ocean. I mean, there's like... You can go deep sea fishing if that's kind of your vibe. There's a ton of great fish around here. You can uh... I actually... You have to talk to Cloak, but I think there is certain spots you can surf in Florida. I mean, Tfue's like... He's not even playing video games anymore, Timmy. He's out there, he's fishing. That really speaks volumes about the video game market, huh? Oh, God, man. Don't get me started on that, man. I'm in a good mood. Tfue is one of the biggest gamers in the world, and this man's streaming himself fishing. Really think about that. I love it, though, man. I tune into his fish shit all the time. I think it's great. I want to go out with him one day. I don't know, that boat would be a little unstable with you on it. That's... He's just not like... That thing is already rocking in those waves. I know, man, I'm just looking at it. I mean... I'm not even gonna get on that. It's gotta... Hitman in 23? Yo. Hitman in 23, I know it's kind of a big deal. But, uh... You're playing with a two-time back-to-back, and Timmy... The goat and the fat man. That's right. Unmute him. Timmy the tornado. How good is he? He's not... He's... He's average. Timmy's average. But you're playing with a two-time back-to-back champion. Oh, okay. Buy me a car. No, no. No way. I'll just mute myself. You are... You are Kings only. Holy shit. Just put push to talk on, Brownie. Yeah, just use push to talk. What? What is this? 1990? I'm a controller? I didn't know I could do that. Don't you guys got foot pedals or something? Nope. No money? Buy me a car? I'm back. I'm back. Tim, I had to buy you back how many times? And buy me a car. Talk shit one more time, I'm out. I mean... Okay. There we go. That's another one. Put it... Put it... Put it... That's five in a row, champ. GG's, doc. GG's, man. I'd really like a damage check and kill check. Two games in a row. Hey, WienerWarrior. We're not... I'm not even doing this. I'm not. I'm not gonna let you try and berate these two games that you actually have done well compared to the dog shit games you've had. I'm not even gonna let you try and speak a false word into my boy WienerWarrior's ear. I'm not even gonna allow that. It just upsets me when someone brings in that Timmy's better. Like, you don't compete in tournaments like me. You don't go to the grand finals of Code Red Tournaments. I compete in tournaments and we both lost. Because you don't get out of the fucking truck. Oh, yeah. The dude was hopped in my fucking truck, dude. Go get yourself a bag of popcorn. We haven't played Valorant in a long time. Go grab your bag of popcorn. That's five games in a row where we just proved we out-destroyed Timmy in Call of Duty and now we're going to Valorant and we're gonna do the exact same thing. There you are. Look at you. In the range. You're already warming up, Timmy. Oh, God. Isn't this PC only? I have no idea. That's a good question. I don't know. Is there friendly fire in this dock here? Oh, shit. You don't ADS in this game, huh? Good start, man. Let's push double doors, huh? Right in? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, coming through the doors there. Right in front of you. Two time back to back. I mean, I'm not even using any of my abilities either. You know what I mean, Timmy? What the fuck is that thing? A lava tornado? Yeah. He faked it. He faked it. No! He faked it, man. Listen! There you go, Timmy. Jesus, guys. Look right through that chest. Look at this guy. No! There it is. I think we got it. Nice. Come on, man! I should have put that Harris blower up there. Another one, another one, another one. We can't give up angles, guys. Jesus, this guy a fucking pro or what? Our problem right now is we're just letting them walk in places. I killed a guy and I almost killed a bomb. He's talking about you, Timmy. I'm just gonna let you guys know I'm holding down A, specifically short A, and no one's gonna get fucking through the two-time. What did you say? What, are you listening to your techno music? I said I'm holding down short A. I'm holding down short A. Nice, Doc. Nice. They're gonna be flying back to you, Doc. Last one's long, long, long, long. Come on, baby! Come on, come on, 11-10. I wouldn't want my first game back any other way. I'm gonna shock them right now, and you're gonna love it. This is a good old classic garage aggressive play. Two garage, two garage. Hi, guys. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Phoenix, and I love Valorant. T-Ghost, can I know more about you, Phoenix? Sure, you may know more about me. What would you like to know? Do you get pitchy? Don't you feel that's inappropriate for this conversation and this game? Hey, I'll answer for you. No, you don't get pitchy. I don't get pitchy. Phoenix, you got an A. Phoenix, you got an A. Phoenix, you got an A. Jesus, man. We gotta play Warzone with this guy. One smoke on the left, one smoke on the right, baby. Stop showing off your voice, Timmy. Stop showing it off. Really? Really? Really? Really? Nice, nice. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Come on, baby. Come on! Hey, guys. Hello. Bro, low-key, bro, sova, are you good? No. I was about to back out, but I believe that you are good. I'm sorry. Sova, do you own a convertible? Own what? Do you own a convertible? Yes. I knew it. Yeah, it's a nice little convertible Sebring. I knew it. Chrysler, if I'm not mistaken. Correct. You know what I like about you, sova? I'm back, Doc. I was just having a conversation, trying to hype up these guys. How'd it go? It went well. He drives a convertible Chrysler. And I think he's living. Doc's been sick these past few days, but your stream has kept me cheering up. Your stream has kept me cheering up. But your stream has kept me cheering up. I'm glad.
