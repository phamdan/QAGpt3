 Dr. Battlefield 2042 beta is live now! I see him. Need some help with that? Yeah, how about you put him down? Just did? No, you didn't. Oh, I see it, the kill feed. Oh! There it is! Close him down. Oh! Oh! Which one you saw? Woo! God dang, man! Got one. Got two. What, the no-scope? See the no-scope side. Hit that guy? Dead. Nice! Can I hit farther up the... Hit him once. Hit the guy by the tree once. Oh, baby! Oh, get this guy. Come on, baby! Let's go! One more! Oh, my God. He's snipe so much. I'll show you. Get the guy. Oh, my God. This is like a sniper's dream. There's the guy looking. Hit him once, right in front of you. Oh, my! Woo! I'm shooting this pilot out of this... There you go. I wanted to land right on the two-time, man. Watch out behind you, Z! Boom! Is that guy? Yes. I thought he was alive. I didn't know he survived. I didn't know he died. I mean... Champs, the official Doctober 2021 Halloween contest is here. Tons of prizes. Prizes, third place, merch package, signed peripheral package, permanent spot in the arena. I mean, we're talking eBay value worth. I couldn't even tell you. Second place, signed and used peripherals from the Docs, signed peripheral package, merch package, permanent spot in the arena. First place, champs, first time ever. Pause the fucking music! Goddamn it. I can't... I feel like I'm shouting over the music or something, Alex. I don't know. It's blasting. I could barely even hear myself. I still can't... I can't even... How loud am I? I can't even tell. Duos. A day with the Doc. Duos with the Doc. Signed, original prototype scopes, signed peripheral package. Merch package and permanent spot. And that goes to the winner. And I'm telling you right now, champs, I don't know if you saw over the weekend, we had the champion from last year already submit. Setting the tone. Let's wake up, Vintage. You are not Japanese. You're not a Tanaka. You're not a Tanaka. But you have so much to teach. The black steel that drips down my back, aka the bulletproof bullet, the Google prototype scope, the built-in LCD LED 1080p 3D Sony technology. I got a hot, s***ty diarrhea. It's about to come out of my butt. I need to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. Yeah, I get the speed. I get the momentum. But where's the violence? Ain't nothing violent about this 11 year old Doc wannabe. Jesus. You think you're a man? They want to go back to back chance. Let's go take a stroll through the arena. What do you think, champs? Past champions. Look at them. State of the art commitment. And that's exactly what we're looking for, for you to make the gallery. Over the course of this month, champs, we're going to be adding top contestants for this year's contest, essentially highlighting our favorites up to that point. You got the guts? What do you mean keep it down? This is my place. This is my gallery. I don't, I didn't see the sign. Yeah, OK, all right, I'll back it up. Josh Hunt, thank you for the 20 super chat doc. I ran into your Champions Club gym on Saturday. We were both ripped out of our minds and chatted up for a bit. Hit me up on the flip phone. You need any more steroids? I don't know. What do you think, Josh? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I say we bounce around games today, champs. Fucking slide. Fucking flash. And this dude's not even firing, you know. God, I'm such a, I am. What happened to my bullets right there? God, I'm running in mud. I'm not going anywhere. I'm holding the sprint button. My guy's arms are going like this. Yeah, you would be fucking crouched. Like the view model is going like this, right? But like my screen, I'm not going anywhere. It comes down to a stupid ass pussy concussion design. This is the speed of my player model going like this. You think he'd be fucking sprinting, right? I just can't. Fucking sliding down the stairs, moving around. But I'm literally going like five feet. It's fucking mind boggling. It is. That's all I can handle right now. I do, I do. I feel good, I do. Boom! Boom! Right, that's what we do. What, I'm scared? Scared to death or what? Ho, ho, ho, I see ya. I found her! Now that was my 360! Oh, baby, baby, baby, boom! The guy tried to, hey, the guy tried to get slick with it. Did you see him champs? Whistling Whistling Whistling I don't know man, who's winning? Champs, who's winning? Doc, that whistling guy is definitely your blood relative. Shut your, shut your mouth up! Oh, Champions Club. On the main stage, we're having a good time. First game in, 200 ping, nothing like a fresh Warzone game to get the game, to get the game today. Things are getting psychotic inside of the arena and that's exactly how I like them.
