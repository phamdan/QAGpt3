 Imagine the start of this fucking battle royale. This 300 man battle royale. You're in your spaceship with your team. You have control of your spaceship as you're flying in through the atmosphere to land somewhere. Just like instead of flying in as a person, you fly in as a spaceship. But you have to get out of the spaceship after a certain time because it's damaged or whatever. That's the fiction. Let's just put a fiction around it. So boom! And then you get down there and it lands and opens up the fucking ramp in the back and then you come sprinting out of it and then it takes off. And so you see a whole bunch of spaceships like land wherever they want and then they take off after. I'm ready to go to play Halo. Like for those that are spamming fucking play a game. Like first off, anyways, if you think my intro's long, it's Timmy. Timmy. It's Timmy's fault. Alright get me in. What are we doing? You guys playing mouse and keyboard? I'm playing on controller. I gotta pay some respect to Halo. I'm playing mouse and keyboard. Alright Lupo, you don't respect the franchise. I get it. Who's this guy? Nobody is close. What do you mean? Who's who? Is that Wade? That's it. Doc, is that you? Why is your name not Dr. Disrespect? Yes, nobody is close. Right, but your name is Dr. Disrespect. Holy shit. Let's go, go, go, go, go! Boom! Style. Yeah, style kid. I got you. I got you Lupo, stay alive. Stay back. No more nades. There's two. Two of them. Two of them. Shit. I got both of them. Get the other one. Get the other one. Who's running? Get him dad! Go! Still ain't sprayed this FYI. What the new combo? Get it running. Did they? No. One guy quit. He didn't want to lose to us. Oh man. We're starting to get warmed up baby! I'm gonna try and flank him. I'm putting a little predicament. I'm flanking one. Right above you Doc. Welcome to my world baby. Good luck Doc. Kill check bro. It's 17. What is the score? 23 to 7. Yeah, kill check though. Killing spree. Have you heard that yet Doc? Oh yeah, I'm on my way right now. Do what you're right Doc, go for it. You're welcome. Oh baby, baby. Yeah, you're welcome. What do you mean you're welcome? Oh, he just got there. Killing frenzy. Oh man, my thumb slipped off my thumbstick for that one! Kill check guys. What the hell is this thing? What's this gun? That's pretty fucking spot on if you ask me. I just got chills. I just got chills. I got goosebumps. You're saying reset your game for settings Doc. What the hell are you talking about? I don't need to reset. Do I have to reset the game for settings? No. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Doc, they're getting you going. Just look at your donuts dude. True, true. Stop reading $500 donation. Sorry, I'm muted. Hi I'm Z and I got my battle rival. I got a hammer now. Is that what I sound like Doc? I got a hammer now. Is that what I sound like? I got a hammer now. Is that what I sound like? This guy's still fucking alive. I don't think I've ever heard Lupo say boom ever since we started being with Z today. He's never ever been like boom. I mean that's kind of just what we do. I'm like you with your fucking hair. It's the same. Boom. Boom. I got a hammer now. I got a hammer now. I got a hammer now. I got a hammer now. I got a hammer now. You are the winner of this game. They should have got you lined up for the voice at the end of every game. I'd love to hear that. Yeah, but Timmy keeps every time I sing goes Scott that was awful. What are you trying to lose viewership like shut the fuck up Timmy? Oh, beautiful. Oh God man. No, give me a weapon. Surprise mother. You gotta be kidding me. Well that would have been cool but here we are. We need three. We need three. 84. Nice. Nice. Let's go baby. Holy shit. Where did I get shot from? I'm dead. Holy shit. Is he in the mid? No he's top of my nest. That's pretty badass Doc. Doc, you ever consider a singing career? Yes, absolutely. I've already got two records in the works right now Timmy. That was beautiful Doc. Can you do me a favor and never do that again? Shut the fuck up. I heard Tim try to sing the other day. He was trying to sing fucking what's that song called? He was trying to sing that? You don't know that song? I've lost about 7k. I haven't had a sniper yet. I haven't had a sniper yet. That's not what I sound like Doc. Sniper. Sniper obtained. All I'm saying is it is like it is the perfect foundation for a battle royale with the warthogs and everything man. In the Halo community they don't like to even think about having a VR and they might not and you know they can grind their rank and do all that shit too. I mean they got it bro, they got it. They think final boss is still competing or something. I feel like they genuinely miss out on VR. Shit I got punched in the ass. Didn't realize they got rockets by the way down bottom. Oh my god that was funny Doc holy shit. Should be a stand up comedian man. Nah I'm gonna sit down one. That's good man. There it is boom invite. You got that yeah. No I just restarted my game. We're good we're good. This man Doc just figured out how to see recent. And he goes boom. Boom. No because I've been working on Steam for the past 45 minutes. True. It's so funny because Steam is the interface is so fucking bad. And it's weird because it's one of the best we got. Isn't that strange? It is crazy. Whatever happened I want to give a shout out to the person that invented and created the Xbox 360 user interface and invite system. Oh yeah. You're a fucking legend. Whoever made that. To this day. I'm in. Timmy let's go. The best invite and friend system I've ever seen Xbox 360. It was so good. I'm clapping for them they're probably not here but. How do we turn on the music. Moving. That was fucking awful. You were off pitch and you were too low. Are you not trying again? Are you through the towel? Hello? What the fuck? What the fuck? That's Tim's try. Doc how about you show us what you can do. I already did. He made fun of levels ready bro. Wow, thanks for watching. It was so good. byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
