 You're looking at the two-time back-to-back 1993-1994 Blockbuster video game champion and true international video gaming superstar. The name is Dr. Dr. Dis Disrespect. Violence, speed, momentum, minimum, minimum, all day long inside of the arena. How long do I have to keep going? When's it going to, when's the song going to start? Fuck man! Holy shit! I don't know who this guy is. The snake dragon Anaconda mucus infiltrating my world, Dadallion's world. All Dadallion is trying to do is get revenge for the murder of his brother. This fucking snake dragon Anaconda wants to get in my way. Oh, you snagged me didn't you? No! No! What is my guy doing? Get go! Oh no. God dang it man. Fucking A man. No! What the fuck? What am I fighting here man? Holy shit. I jump? There's no way. Go go! What the? I got him off! No, that's... That is bullshit. You break my record. Now I break you. Just like I break your friend. I will pull it off. And then you throw in your double special with the sword. You know what the double special is. One strike and then an uppercut. And that's a great time to throw the third one in there. And just like that you're already off to a great start. And that's okay. Throw a jump and attack at him if you can. There you go. You got him off balance. That's perfect. Remember there's no avoiding that one. You're just going to have to take the damage and you're going to have to be ready to heal back up. Doesn't it feel good? And just like that. Well done. Make sure you get your guy that you're going to summon in position. You're going to need magic right out of the gate. You didn't get your magic off, but that's fine. Now we're working into the second chapter on a dragon snake and this is where things get fun. There are elements involved with this second phase of this creature. Some of those elements volcanic ash fire lightning strikes and death skulls. Be efficient be tactical in your approach and don't overthink things. Let's get it started shall we? I'm done. I'm done. I'm done fighting it. I got to go explore. Let's go to down. I need to feel powerful right now. Let's go back to limb grave. Let's walk around a little bit. We'll come back to it. Trust me. I'll be back. What do we got? Nacron the internal city. Look at this place. You ever seen a lightning strike? Feel that. And then buffed. This guy's got lightning. Oh shit. Oh God. He's really good with it. Oh, yeah. I do too. And then we'll go back. We'll level up our sword. Maybe level up this ash and then we'll take down the dragon easy. I'm sorry, but whoever I'm about to fight is about to get destroyed. No doubt about it. Look at this. It's a two time. Oh, all right. All right. Okay. Oh, yeah. We're just going to we're going to pummel you to death. Just FYI. We're going to pummel you to death. Just want to let you know that.
