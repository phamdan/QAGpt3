 Timmy the Pooh? It's good seeing you two. Because Warzone is so easy on a controller, man! Holy shit, you can close your eyes! Do you need controller settings? From you? I got it from one of the best controller players in the world. Oh Timmy, I mean you got a lot to learn when it comes to controller, man. I've been playing controller since Atari 2600. Okay Timmy? That is true, you have been playing for a very long time. You got an announcement later today? I had an announcement, but I actually did a... Are you curious what it is, Doc? I'm ready, are you even online right now? What are you doing? What's the announcement? I'm waiting for it. Well you didn't say you wanted an announcement! I'm just trying to be a good friend here. Okay, the announcement was that I am having the honor to partner up with AT&T. We are doing something that I've never done before. And I'm going to three different spots and streaming from three different spots. And I'm going to be doing a video on the power of AT&T. But I'm not saying where. Okay. Sorry Timmy, I was thrown off by the intro of this Call of Duty thing. So I might have missed some of the stuff that you said something about AT&T. As long as you got the gist of it, I think we're good, right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, you got it. Okay dude, I'm back bro. I'm sorry. Hello? What happened Timmy? Dude, I fucking, I went out there and my fish was drowning. But how does a fish drown? I don't know man, it was just in the water and he was like drowning. You get enough oxygen in there? You got the little bubble thing that like puts... Yeah, bubbles, like in Finding Nemo. Uh huh. Okay, anywho, let's uh, what are we doing Doc? It's just you and me, right? Yeah I've got the controller, I mean it's ready. I have controller ready as well. You're gonna be a disaster today man. How do you slide cancel? Oh shit. Where's my fucking aim assist? What is this guy doing? Look how easy it is Timmy. That was bad bro. That was questionable right there, I can't deny. I kind of want to test my aim assist on this guy. It's not catching, it's like weird. You see what I'm saying champs? Like that's supposed to catch. It's not. Am I right champs? That's supposed to catch, like it's supposed to move. Weird. I'm the headie right there, I missed every shot Doc. Missed every shot. Man I'm bad. Yeah you are. What'd he say? He said, man I'm bad. Like he was from Frisco, Texas. Right above me. You don't lose fights up close, it's just super easy. You know what I mean? Here he is, he's on me, he's on me. Beautiful. Oh what an idiot. God you're so stupid. Why'd you guys plan on playing controller today? You guys just wanted to prove a point or something? I am defending controller players, I'll have you know. And Doc is trying to make it a joke right? Yep. He's trying to say aim assist is the easiest thing ever. Yep. One of them went up the stairs here, he's probably going to peek the window. Yeah he's right here. Timmy! Timmy! Timmy! You fucking lost that? No shot right? What do you mean? Because you went right in front of me. Your big body blocked everything. Come on Doc! Yeah! Even if I wanted to not aim at that guy, there's no way I'm breaking the magnetism. Especially close range. The magnetism. What I wanted to do today Timmy, was that a lot of people on Monday felt that I was being mean to you regarding your announcement of joining an org and co-owning. So I just, I'd like to step in, be the man, and tell you congratulations on becoming co-owner of Team Complexion. And uh, congrats. That was really from the heart. That took a lot for Doc to do that Tim. Thanks bro. Hey I gotta wrap up this ad, hang on. What's he doing an ad for? Well, like probably some beauty products or something right? Is it? I mean. Is he coming out with his own makeup palette or something? Team Complexion. Tim is like the love child of Michael Rapaport and Sloth from the Goonies. Jesus, that's not very nice golf. I want to get back into our groove. What groove? Hell yeah, what do you mean? There's been no groove today. Listen, I'm just getting started. I feel really good on the controller. I'm just not finding people, I'm not finding the right fights. Not finding people. Doc, that doesn't even make sense. Let's see if you can get out of the gulag, Timmy. I got out of the gulag last game, bot! I've been in better positions. This guy just jumped down, he's in the first hanger. Let me go on as Timmy, I don't know what the hell he's doing. Look at this guy. Let me just stand up here. Let me stand up on the top of the staircase and look at my little heartbeat sensor. Shut the fuck up, alright? Who's playing, who's not? Oh, I got someone on my heartbeat sensor. Let me take a look now. Oh, let me change my focus and shoot at these helicopters that have nothing to do with the conversation that's in front of us at the hangars, guys. There's two buy zones right around you. Opposite roof. What am I watching, Timmy? Like what are you looking at? I can't get the fuck out of here, man. He seems to just not be getting shot at all. Ever. He never gets shot, Timmy. He never gets shot. And this guy in the bottom of our building? Coming up your stairs, yeah, he's coming up to you. Look at that. You didn't even have to do anything, huh, Timmy? That guy's fucking terrible, holy shit. Yeah, I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. Oh fuck. Oh fuck, fuck, fuck, god! Dude! I'm safe. I'm safe. I'm safe. I'm safe. I'm safe. It's literally 15 feet in front of you guys. Yeah, but there's people all around it, Don. It's in the wide open. God, I gotta watch Z. I gotta watch Z. Holy shit. I need a plate, Z. I need a plate, Rho. Help! Holy fuck. OK, back on, Timmy. Did Daddy push the guy right next to us? Thoughts? Let's go! I'm going, I'm going with you. Oh, I'm going. Get away from him. Okay. Okay. Man, that was real tough to get out of, huh Timmy? Go up there, show them your controller power. Timmy, show them the controller power, baby! There you go! Oh... That's what I'm saying, bro. Where's the fucking aim assist there, huh? Like, just get in a little bit through the line. It's not that strong! See, what if you've been doing this whole fucking time, man? Actual. I'm waiting for this guy. Get me up! Sometimes Z does that, Timmy. I've got you! I mean, homie, this is crazy. Look at this. Oh, Tim. Oh, Timmy. See what I mean? Like, I'm bad, guys. Timmy, Timmy, Timmy. Oh, Timmy. Oh, Timmy. Oh, Timmy. Alright, guys, please. Alright, dude. Oh, Timmy. Oh, Tim. Hey, listen, listen. If anything, we need to post that clip to Twitter right now to prove to end this feud of keyboard and mouse versus controller. Because every single keyboard and mouse player right now that's talking shit, saying it's just that easy. I mean, that's a perfect Twitter clip. That's a perfect Twitter clip. No, Timmy's not the one that should be representing it. Fuck, you were dead that whole game, okay? And it's not because we couldn't get you, it's because you shouldn't have died in the first place. I agree. I'm still, I meant to throw the grenade, but I'm pressing the wrong button on the controller. That's how I died. I got a funny story, champs. I got a funny story. It was rolling yesterday. So baby assassin gets home from school, yada, yada, yada. So I go up to her and I ask her, I said, I don't want to be that guy like, how was your day? What did you, like, what did you, what did you learn today? First thing I ask is, hey, did anything funny happen at school today? Boom. She had a story and that's exactly, that's all I wanted. She said it was the funniest thing ever and she's the one that let the whole school know. I'm like, what is it? She's like, when I went to go to the bathroom, there was the biggest piece of poop and it was this big in the toilet and it had toilet paper all over it and stuff inside the poop and I had to tell my friends and then my friends came over and saw it and we were all laughing and then we showed the teacher and then the whole school knew. But she was so happy and proud that she was the one that like was able to discover this. It got around according to her in her class. That was a good one. The limited edition doctor disrespect collection. There it is champs. And I swear if I see anything on eBay and I'm not getting a cut, I'm going to be pissed. Heart rate is steady. Respiration is normal. Body temperature hasn't changed. He's been on there for over 10 hours. Be careful, it's too much. We need his essence. These prototypes are useless without it. We need to try something else. What is the best vein for you? All of them. My God, the vascularity. I know. We've got to find another way. Hey, you're going to have to figure it out. Careful. It's an Ethiopian caterpillar. And it'll bite. Is this poisonous? Is this poisonous? I just need your signature and your initials. We don't need to sign anything. It's required by corporate. Stop right there. They're beautiful. Set it up. I said set it up. Anyone can be good, but to be the best means everything about you needs to be the best. Your speed, style, everything needs to be on point. Only then will you achieve champion grade. Oh, man, look at that, champs. Get rid of that. There's the collection, champs. Overall, good day, too. I mean, well... I mean, solid. On controller, I need like a full squad. It would have to be like three or four of us, like all day. You and I aren't going to be able to do well with me on controller. I'm like relearning everything. It's crazy. But it was fun. I liked it. I appreciate it. That was fun. I appreciate the games. And you're not here tomorrow. I'll see you Friday. See you Friday, Timmy. Okay. Later, man. Later. Oh, can we get some firm handshakes for Timmy the Pooh? Oh, Timmy the Pooh, there he is.
