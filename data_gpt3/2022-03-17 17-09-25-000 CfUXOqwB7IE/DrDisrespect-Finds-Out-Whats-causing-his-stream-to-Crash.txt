 What the hell is going on around here? What's going on with the glitches around my arena? Alex, I thought we... Alex! Jesus! Jesus! Alex! Yeah, I thought we... I thought we were going to get this cleaned up. I don't know, I'm still seeing the wires right next to the shower. Can you hear me on the Bluetooth? Yeah. All right. Well, I'm on my way in. Okay, we'll take a look. Yeah, so I'm following the wires. I'm following the wires. Alex, it's the same door, man. I don't know, how do we get inside? I swear, if I had a penny for every time my stream's been glitching out over the past two years, I can almost pay Alex a monthly salary. Almost. On-site presence established. Variant identified. Doctor disrespect. The wires, the glitches. All leads back to here, huh? So tell me, what the hell are you doing in my arena? Energy requirements rising. Arena power grid appropriated. Access pass protocol initiated. Founder access pass granted. Access to Project Moon testing grounds granted. Access to council voting rights granted. Access to variant rallying points granted. Access to variant gear drops granted. Generating variant, Doctor disrespect visor cortex generating 1993 visor cortex. I think the two-time back-to-back video game champion deserves more recognition than just a single cortex. Request granted. Two visor cortex for the two-time, generating 1994 visor cortex. Rendering 9,998 more variants. Law user action requested. There is no turning back. I mean, look at the quality of these PFPs. All procedurally generated, well, perhaps except for maybe the two that I receive. It's a little custom for me, but... I mean, just look at these bad boys. And what's cool about our PFPs is that we have... I don't know how many attributes we have associated with them, like 13 or 14. You know, like the background, the weather, the type of weather, the left shoulder, aka the steel rail, right? The hairstyle, aka, I think we've classified this as the steel skullet. Obviously, the visor cortexes, the body, the weapon. Pretty cool, man. And that's a part along with the many other benefits of becoming an Access Pass holder, if you qualify. Right? We're not just handing it, like, we're not just saying, yeah, you're approved, you're approved, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We want the best. We want the people that really want to change the game. Really want to make an impact that really want to feel like they have ownership in this thing. And that's what it's about. Remember, you don't have to have NFTs to play our game. It doesn't change that experience at all. And it'll continue to be free to play and you can't buy your way to win. We're not interested in any of that stuff. This is all in regards to our Access Founders Pass, and by the way, here's something that comes along with it. A procedurally sick-ass generated PFP that captures the soul of this community that we're building here in Midnight Society. I'm glad we talked that out. Project Moon, it's underway. The details around that, give us some time. One quarter. One game. The objective is to win the game. That's exactly what I'm going to do, Champions Club. Check your gear and weapons. Go, sir. John! What? I can't hear you this game. Hold on, let me turn this game down, man. There. I got one game. And I'm putting a personalized stamp of approval. Doc guarantee. That's the two times winning. Let's go! Let's go, let's go! Let's go, go, go, go, go, go! A lot of ratty players that play Solos, champs. I feel dialed in. I'm warmed up. No doubt about it. No doubt about it. Guaranteed. First shot of the day. Let me get it warmed up. Push them down, overwhelm them, suffocate them, squeeze them. Understand them. I'm right here, bro. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. One quarter, one game. I'm just going to lay here, I don't think he's going to find me. Come on, get your aim going. I'm just gonna lay here, I don't think he's gonna find me. Come on, get your aim going! Whoa! Right into the next chapter. Phase two of Call of Duty Warzone. Phase two! This guy made a mistake. Where you going? This guy's gone, I mean like, what are you gonna do? Huh champ? Let's wake up. Let's wake the fuck up. Oh shit. Oh dude, bro. Dude, what the fu- Oh bro! Fighting? Oh now you're dead. No look, huh? 37 bullets AR. Something to keep in mind. Something to keep in mind. I'm gonna give him a little tap on the head right here. Boom. Just a little tap. Yep, he's gonna crossbow. Just enough. Just enough. Just enough. Just enough. You know? Oh shit. Go ask Tim the Tap Man when the last time he's won a solo. Doc, you're literally the best. Nobody, I mean nobody is even close. Hey Brandon, thank you for the $9.99. I wish you could- I wish you'd- Hey. I wish you'd tell YouTube Gaming that. They don't even follow me on Twitter, man. Can you believe that? The person that put their gaming, live gaming on the map. They don't even follow. It's alright. See, that's what I'm saying. That's a good- That's an example. And you know what? It just- It just drives me, man. It's just like, alright. It's like, you know when I think about these things? Right after I shave. And then I put the hottest, most acidic aftershave on my face so it burns. When I'm doing that, it's just like, yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay. Alright.
