 Last time I went to the gym I did that. Right before a set. I didn't even get to finish the set champs. I was being escorted out of the place. I'm on a whole other level now. I'm going to peek it. Start the game, Doc! Fuck! I mean, what angle do you want it at, man? What, you want this elbow a little bit closer to you? I mean, what angle do you want it at, man? What, you want this elbow a little bit closer to you? Yeah, great reality check. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run. Oh, it pushed me back! It bounced off the wall! The vehicle hit the wall and it threw back, man. Peek then! Peek then! Fuck, I get locked in! I don't even see him! No! How are you not blind?! Like, why are we pushing through?! I'm lost right now. I... I... I... Come on, Doc! Step out of it! You're like in another dimension! Step out of it! Is this what everyone does? Is this crouch? Fucking what?! Is that what everyone does?! Holy shit, grow some balls! Holy shit, grow some balls! I'm too drunk to drive, I can't even lie, I can't even tonight I had to watch out, but now I'm too drunk tonight I can't even lie I mean, there's better, and then there's way better. I had to watch out, but now I'm too drunk tonight I can't even lie And it's pretty obvious I'm way better. You know what I mean, Chance? It's pretty obvious. Yeah, what a song! Let's get going! It's showtime! Pretty obvious, I'm the fucking best with a sniper, just stick with it, man! Bye-bye. Oh my god. Get locked in, we're landing at Nakatomi Plaza. Disable, disable. Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see. Dude, do we jump out right here? What's he doing?! BOOM! What is he doing?! I'm already bored of the gulag. I was facing this guy, I got disinterested, now I'm back. Then I fucking melt him. I could be locked in or I could be completely disinterested, it's up to you. Let me hold out my heartbeat, Chancho. Oh, he's right here, let me use my aim assist and lock on him. Hey, Charlie! It's breakfast time, Charlie! Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakayaya. Tomi Plaza. Welcome to Nakatomi Plaza. I've seen a lot of gameplay of Nakayaya Tomi Plaza. Get locked in, we're landing at Nakatomi Plaza. So today, every single game... No! Get dried again! Every single fucking game, we're landing... It's time... At Nakatomi Plaza! At Nakayaya Tomi Plaza. That sucks. So we gotta go up too deep. Shoot him in the back! Oh my god. Fucking controller player! You okay, buddy? Yeah. Chupacchi? Where am I? Oh, look at you. I don't know where I'm at. I don't know what the fuck just happened. Oh shit. Hakamuko Jim and Nakatomi. Not one. What the fuck? Jotan today. Jotan today. Violencia, Velocidad y Momento. Winner takes it all till he breaks the fall in time, you'll make it over the top. Is that... what song is that? Is that an existing three lines? If so, what song? If it's not, you wouldn't mind if I potentially use that, would you? Time to earn your freedom, soldier. Oh, are you crouching? Are you crouching? Huh? Oh, you almost got me there. Well, let me stun you now. Boom, now you're stunned. I do a 360 like that, and then I go boom! And then I go boom! Right? And then I go boom! That's what I fucking do. That's what I do. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. What do you mean, come on, man? I mean, this is a headshot. 100% champs. I don't know what else to say. Boom! Right there, like right here. Boom, right here. Easy. Doc, after reviewing the play, it is overturned. It's 100% a headshot. Headshot, headshot. Headshot. 100% headshot. 100% headshot. I gotta get the timing right. 100% headshot. 100% headshot. Okay, hold on. 100% headshot. 100% headshot. 100% headshot. 100% headshot. Okay, all right. One more time. I just want to hear it one more time. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I messed up. 100% headshot. 100% headshot. 100% headshot. At this rate, I want to be surprised if you're nominated for a Grammy for Best Producer. This is Jocelyn's Galaxy with a $4.99. Hey, listen, don't give Alex too much credit. I don't even think anybody is even close to me. I'm on a whole other fucking level. I'm gonna run you to the aisle. Nobody's gonna get in my way. Nobody, nobody, nobody. I don't even think anybody is even close to me. I'm on a whole other fuckin' level. Nobody's gonna get away with nobody, nobody, nobody! Nobody cares even close to me! I'm a fucking love! Nobody's gonna get away with nobody, nobody, nobody!
