 You're looking at the two-time back-to-back over here live. Polygon Studios. Buckle in. Can you tell my wife it was all worth it in golfing? Oh yeah. I'm going to the restroom, I'm going to be back out. Can I sign this real quick? It says DRD, Dr. D, not dad, D. Alright, alright. I just want to make sure. Hey, what's going on? I guess when you're talking to the two-time, you're going to have a problem. Charles, I don't know what your excuse is for not being here, but I would like to. You're going to change that attitude. You're going to come back with a little bit more vengeance, a little bit more violence, speed and momentum. And you're going to be faking a few times and you're good. Gillette, the best a man can get. Gillette. Hey, you want to sing this with me? Right now? The best a man can get. How do you want me to match to that? I can't match that. Yeah, you got to match it. No? Alright. Someone didn't mention new game mode, Last Spartan Standing. I don't know if it's any good. Variety streaming? Yeah, I mean, what am I to do? Shut the f**king guy below you! What a stupid... F**king Ronin sucks at this game. There you go. Nice audio. Oh, the zone closes in. I like that. Got a little shotty waiting for you. Oh my! F**k down! Yeah, nice. Nice. Nice footsteps. We traded? Someone... No, no, no. We're not going to... Someone f**king clip that last spot right there. I'll come. I'll come. I'll come. I'm going to back it down a little bit. Too much. Back it down to 480. Why? Why are we doing this? YouTube! Are we not optimizing clips? I want to see playback speed at 25%. And I want it to be super smooth. Like, when I go like this and then kind of rewind it. You know? Without this. Circling. That's what I would like. I love that. Love that. I can't even watch it! How many f**king times? I stuck in three times with this thing. How many more clips? Not this guy. Unfortunately I can'tapplause you now if you don't get... I imagine you did the normal way. little corner go your little corners i'm so fucking tired is 15 to 17 and it came down to the final two. Came down to the final two. Doc, you need to focus on the wind. You focus on your face. Hey Doc, when can we expect to see the finale of Daedalian's Revenge? Uh, let's see, I'll add two more months. Probably what, three years? Doc, if you're considering trying out PlanetSide 2, no, Jesus, not interested in playing 25 year old games. Doctor, Doctor Daddy, there's respect, how come you are, how come you are our daddy but not us? Julian, I'm not your f***ing daddy, alright? Jesus. Didn't you just hear what I said about Quake? I'm not going to ever play that. I think because I'm, because people keep asking me. Doc, when can we expect a game from Midnight Society? Says Danger Levi with a 9.99. Probably like 40 years. And I'm going to push it back another 20 years every time I get asked. Oh yeah, just get Knubs out of here. You got a lot to learn. Especially that ugly looking Honda Accord that you drive to your job at Arby's. Alright, shut the f*** up you p****y. F*** out of the arena. Okay, this putt to win the hole. I don't know if I'm in a grumpy mood today or what. Or if it's you guys really pissing me off. I need to close down chat. God, that's f***ing A man. Oh s***. Oh. Doc, I need advice on an outfit for my wedding. Says Forever Mediocre with $19.94. I say go with some like, I'd say go with combat boots. And if your hair is long enough, put it in a ponytail, man.
