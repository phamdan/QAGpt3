 Doc's with respect, and we're here at the Niners vs Cowboys game inside of the Dallas stadium. How about them Cowboys? How about them Niners? And the 49ers, what a run! Touchdown San Francisco! The game is over and San Francisco survives and advances. Hey Demi, it's like the end of the fourth quarter. I'm just coming out here. I just want to make sure that we kind of connect. Yeah right dude, everyone's fucking gone because we won. Good luck next year. Doc, listen man, all right, refs 100% had money on the game. You can't change my mind. That man, R55, had his mortgage literally on the 49ers. And on top of that, homie, it is 7 o'clock at night. You were literally wearing sunglasses inside like, what the fuck I'm doing? Bro, hey bro, the refs, bro. He hasn't been talking about it because he knows. I mean, there's already articles like, refs got it right. Let's just not even look at, let's not look in the direction of referees. Okay, don't even bring it up. It's actually kind of a, it's actually a stupid excuse and I don't like it. I'm starting to get pissed off. We went in there and we actually dominated. It shouldn't have been that close. It should have been like 34 to 11, but nonetheless, what a game, what a game. Huh? What a game, what a game. Holding it, man. Holding the command center, isn't it? Put my scarf on. That's better than whatever the fuck you're writing. I know how to fucking do this, man. Doc's watching me right now. Yeah. Actual? Yeah, yeah. Is Doc watching? Yeah, yeah, I am. Wait, is Doc watching right now? Yeah, right now. Is Doc watching? I am right now. Yeah. He's watching right now. Yeah, yeah. Y'all are gonna get fucking torched in Green Bay, bro. I'll catch it out. No, I'll catch it after the broadcast. Yeah. Hello. Jimmy. What's going on? Just good old classic Fortnite gameplay. Is it good? I mean, I don't know what I'm fucking doing in 99% of these fight battles. Whatever you want to call them. I don't know what I'm doing. Trying to build battles is a word for it, bro. Yeah, build battles. So we're going to talk about the elephant in the room and I'm not talking about me. I mean, first off, I mean, could you even see anything from way up there, Timmy? I could see everything, Doc. Jesus. I could actually watch the plays unfold. It was a lot of fun. Like the true score of the game could have been, it really could have been 34 to 11. Yeah. But I don't want to get into it, you know, I mean, it's up to you. It's on you. That game should not have been that close for you and your guys sake. We had 13, we had 14 penalties against ourselves. I agree. You didn't want to hang out after the game, Doc? Fuckhead. No text back? What are you, three sheets to the wind or something? Listen, we were, we were, we were at Texas live celebrating. Okay. Early flight the next morning. It wasn't a big, heavy celebration, Timmy. You know, we're in, we're out. Private jets minimum. Mm-hmm. We're at the tippity top, but we're really only halfway up. We're in peak condition and we're not even in shape. It's reality check season. Tilted Towers is back. All right, where's Tilted? Did I already pass it? Is this all Tilted? I'm just getting comfortable with the controls right now. It's nothing but Tilted Towers today, champ. Fortnight in 2022, who would have thought? Oh, you're lucky you landed right there, dude.

What a little trio of champions? had you guys need help? Listen, I've been, I've been looking at Timmy trying to fucking res me for the last 20 minutes. He can't. He just can't. Doc's fucking awful.
