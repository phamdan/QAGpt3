 Ladies and gentlemen, we're on board Tim the tap man. ADSing a ladder. He's staying ADS with only 2200 and no plates actually kills the guy. Holy shit. This guy's cracked. You guys still fighting? Yeah, same guy. Yeah, those kids were definitely in our game earlier. What do you say, dog? He said you're good looking. I didn't have it. This guy just landed. Look at him, dude. Where's the other guy you just killed? On the outside over here. He's getting my guy. He's driving out from the super right now. I'm just kidding. Get him out! Good job boys. Get him out of my game. Kill count. We're not doing this. Alright guys, down. Just land please. It's not that hard. This is me. Oh my god. It's not Tim, it's Doc. I'll take care of the birth of three guys. Look at him, he's still alive. I'll take care of him. Dude, right there. Right in front of you. Oh my god. Oh baby. Back on blue? Okay, yeah. Whoa, we got a couple teams up here by blue. What the... What's it... What just happened? Back on blue? Okay, yeah. Whoa, we got a couple teams up here by blue. What the... What's it... That's on Tim. What just happened? That is entirely on Tim. That is entirely on Tim. What the fuck just happened? That is entirely on Tim. That is entirely on Tim. That is entirely on Tim. That is entirely on Tim. That is entirely on Tim. Tim just hit maneuver Doc and I and then flipped our car and blew us up. I didn't mean to hit you guys either. Straight up. I apologize. I don't know how that happened. I did not intend to do that. I was just trying to go across the map with you guys. I don't even want the apology. Okay, suck my ass. That boy suck. I got to admit, Courage, I look younger than you. I actually stand by that. Okay, gray hair. Okay, gray hair. I stand by that. Look at the black steel. Hell, you talking about gray hair. Look at this thing. Silver hair, okay. Doc, I mean, doesn't C have a target? I don't know. I mean, doesn't C have a tournament tomorrow? Are you in that? Yeah, I am. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I didn't know if you were in that. I certainly know you don't want to compete. How do I get in? Is this C's whole tournament? I think it is. I think we already got three, but I don't... I'm good. I don't want to hit you guys and have to kick somebody or anything. I don't know if the dripping in heat is... You know, if you're ready for it. I'm looking for that. I'm looking for a guy who's really and better than you, chat. Please get your boy. I mean, get him. Someone help him. That'd be a fucking tournament though. Imagine. Oh, they're doing a recon here. It'd be a disaster. All right, here we go. That's a round one exit if I've ever heard of that. Jack, fat bitch. Oh, it's all reloaded. Oh, shit. You get him? Got him. Got him. It's us, Lupo. It's us. I'd be climbing up to you. Am I going to land on the loady? There was a guy near there. What happens when you want to get involved? We're going right into the big... No, no, no! No! Jesus, Courage! No! What are you jumping off for? Look at him. Clueless. They're looking for us. Yeah, yeah, yeah. One more. Oh, yeah. Another one, another one, another one. Oh, my God, help me! Oh, my God, help me! He's smashed. Boom, see ya. I was the comms of that entire team right there. Did you see his little red arrow just turn around? His three buddies went down and that dude whipped around, bro. He was coming down to the C-Mate and he just got the fuck out of there. Just think about what his parents think about his communication. Honestly, let him res his teammates and you guys go to that place. Oh, there he is. Oh, my... You stole that? No, no, no, that was you. Did you hear his howl? You stole it! You got it! He was not having that, bro. Turn off the stream. The steroids changed his voice. Notice, you don't know the sideways technique. I just gained like 40 yards on you. Look at that. You want to hop on my birthday with me? Yes, sir. I'm coming. Alright, Jack, thank you. You're fine. Cassie's moving in. You safe, son. Go, go. There you go. Alright. I think there's three guys in here. At least two. There's three in there and one to my left. Oh, here. Oh, no. How can I see you? That's crazy. What? It's just never enough, is it? It's never enough! It's never enough! It's good to have Timmy. Good to have Lupo back. Courage JD. There's that inevitable question though. What's Nick doing, man? It feels like... It's been a long time, but it actually feels like it was yesterday that we just played with Tim. I mean, it's that easy. But at the same time, I'm also saying it feels like we're playing the exact same game from a year ago. Are you kidding me? There's nothing else? Doctor Disrespect's Diarrhea Simulator. So here's how the game's played. Because I know people are into these fucking simulator games. You know, like lawnmowers simulator. Diarrhea Simulator. So here's how it starts. Basically, you start with Doc walking down the street and he runs across a store. He's got multiple choices of stores and restaurants. Maybe he's at a restaurant row of Mexican food, Italian food, you know what I mean? And American food. There's a taqueria right across the street. Whatever. You get to choose what he eats, and based on what he eats there's a reaction inside of his stomach. Depending on how severe it is, you're gonna have to get him to a restaurant. Or a bathroom, excuse me. As fast as you can, or maybe you can take your time. Maybe you can get into the Lambo and drive around a little bit. You'll see a meter. You get him into the bathroom and then there's the simulation of... But then you get to see what it's like. You get to turn around, see the type of poop or diarrhea. Depending on how acidic it is. And... Anyways. I feel like that could be a hit. And maybe it's just Diarrhea Simulator and then we just include other people. Like Timmy, what are his bowel movements? You know? Maybe we'll throw in Curse JD or Lupo. I know XQC likes to play all these simulator games. Maybe we throw him in. And then we just do all the voice acting. Like you're actually playing the character. So you're gonna see him talk. You're gonna hear him grunt. You know like... Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? This thing, hey, I'm on to something. Where do I buy the poo poo game? Sign me up. See? It's already... We're taking pre-orders. I'm taking pre-orders right now. Genius idea, Doc. Thank you. I thought really hard about it. Yeah, I think one of the key elements in the Diarrhea Simulator is that you're able to be able to, like after you're done, you get to turn around and look into the toilet. It could be a solid log, it could be a couple logs, it could be a splatter, it could be just all juice. It could be little small chunks. It could be just a lot of poop. So like the goal is to make sure that your wiping is as clean and as efficient as possible. That's basically the simulator, right? What's the end game of simulators? There's really no end game. Doc, let's talk about the co-op multiplayer aspect of Doc's Diarrhea Simulator. This is Scott B. with a $5 donation. Yes. So, you know, there might be instances where you run out of toilet paper. And now you need your partner who's on the other side of the street, who just ate a corned asada burrito, whose stomach is also bubbling. They're going to have to figure out a way to be able to get to you, get you your toilet paper, while managing themselves as well. Right? So it becomes a diarrhea panic situation. And that's exactly, like I like your thinking. That's a great idea. Diarrhea panic. Toilet paper skins. Yes. Talk to me guys, I'm writing this down, Doc. Pure gold. So I actually pitched this one to my business partner. We haven't talked since, so I don't... But I feel like it's something that we could knock out, like literally, we could probably build this thing out in like two or three months. No joke. Like, Doc, you should be able to pick up what you eat to produce the best hot caca. Says Colin Bryant with a $50 Super Chat donation. Now that's getting a little weird. You're pretty sick in the head. There's all types of different bathrooms too. Like maybe there's a bathroom where it's, again, like kind of cramped, not sanitized. Maybe there's one that's inside like a hotel lobby that you somehow like you found on the street. And it's nice. It's marble. It's Greek marble floors. You got all the space in the world. Right? There might be one where the only stall that's available, it's a handicapped stall. So now here, it's like, so you go into there, you start taking this diarrhea shit, right? And all of a sudden, like you kind of look underneath the stall, and the door opens to the bathroom, and here comes a guy in a wheelchair. And guess what? You took the handicapped stall. Now you're dealing with a different element, why you're taking a diarrhea. Like we could throw these little curve balls at you, man. I think there's something, there's something here. There really is. Maybe you accidentally walk into like the girls' bathroom or something. How do you get out of that? Boston Ryan, thank you for the 324. What's the penalty for wiping back to front or wiping standing up? Yes, we're going to definitely add a skill set to how you wipe your ass, depending on the audio of your shit. Right? You gotta know. Like if it's a super hot, juicy, acidic, goosebump driven diarrhea, you're not going to get toilet paper and go right in there and just wipe. You know that you have to dab it first, because, or else it's just going to melt. And your fingers are going to go right through anyway. So I don't... Um..................... Will there be an unlockable bidet? Maybe. You got one excited... You got one excited duck, Damp. Got one excited duck. What a fun day. Good to see Timmy back. Good to see Lupo on the platform. Curse JD. Um.........................................................
