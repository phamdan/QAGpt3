 A lot of desperation, a lot of no-lifes, a lot of jobless no-lifes that lives in their mom's basement, not even trying. I still truly believe it's going to be one of those days, Doc, one of those great days. Something good is going to happen here. Message received, Z. Listen, Champions Club... Once we lock in... Message received, Z. Listen, Champions Club, you're probably thinking, Doctor, when are you going to delete this game for good? Why are you guys thinking that? We're just getting started, I'm just getting warmed up. The movement, the understanding of the pacing and all the little chubby cheek wannabes. Unathletic gamers. That are desperate for attention, they just want to touch the two-time, they want to touch success. They want a glimpse of them. Then bring it, you little pussy. What the fuck? Jump on in. Oh, baby! That's what we like to see. Where you going? I don't know what happened. I was like a bad guy from an action movie that just... One of the extras in a particular action scene. He's the first one to go flying on the edge of the helicopter. Now you're showing off. What is he saying? He's saying, how come you coach him but not me? How come you coach him but not me? Sniper right in his face. He's one shot, he's going to jump out. Boom! It's like an action movie. Let's keep it going! Yeah, he's dead. Headshot. Awesome game, dude! Oh my God, man! He's reloaded. He's gone. Good stuff, baby! That's a big one! Oh my God! Holy shit! Hit the guy on the left. Down the guy on the right. Knock him, knock him. Close to me. How about this little nade though? Slide right in there. Boom! Blue shielded. Yeah! Where's he at? Where is he? My wife asked me while I was running down the dark alleyways naked, covered in Vaseline, dripping from head to tippy toe. What should I tell her? She says the queen beast mode with a $3 donation, that you're on drugs. That's what we like to see, the Tom Brady, the VSM. No! Doc, can you just wear my blazer and put the bow tie on my tally-weckers? No. Just pre-ordered the memoir, thank you. It's some good donations. Oh yeah, I'm not even going to look at this guy. Where am I? I'm going to continue to read your donation. Thank you, Mason. I'm going to continue to read your donation. Thank you, Mason. Now look. Boom, there's one. Boom, there's two. You guys see? Champs, I got an idea. If you ever have Phoenix, let me just give you an inside look on an advanced play that I just thought of right now. Okay? Hopefully I can get there. I've got nine seconds, eight seconds. Let's see if I can get there. Hold on. Nice. Defenders win. 30 seconds left. 78, Vipers. Going up. Boom, boom, boom, boom. I'm fucking reading this game like it's nothing. I don't know what this green gas is, Champs. No idea. I like that, man. Quit the hell with it. You know when you're in like first grade or kindergarten first grade? Remember those big huge blow up planetarium thing they bring to school and you crawl through and it blows up and they put all the different constellations inside of it? Man. Anyways, that's what that reminds me of. Mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic. Mic check. One, two, three. Hey. Stop talking. I'm just trying to get some team bonding here. Come on, baby. I'll do it. I'll do it. One little peek. One little peek. Come on. What's the plan here? Don't you throw it. Oh, I like this. How come nobody told me about this character? How come you tell them about this character but not me? Do you have a voice modifier? I don't. I sound like the doc though, huh? Everyone keeps telling me that. You have a beautiful voice. Thank you. I appreciate it. Like you could take me to as many things. Just give them love tonight. Revealing Eddie. All right. You need a stop. You're getting a little bit excited. Content creator is the word now. Are you a streamer? Content creator? Are you a YouTuber? You're so much bigger than that. That's the type of start I want. I gotta speed up my thinking now. Let's speed up my thinking. Let's win this. Give me a little peek. See, now we're starting to think. Now we're starting to think, champs. Guess what? It fucking clicked. That's what this game is about, man. And that's why I love it so much. Once you're in, you're in. But you gotta get there, champs. Sometimes it's not easy. Sometimes it takes a couple gaming sessions. Especially if you're brand new to this. But once you're in, you're in. What would you do for a Klondike bar?
