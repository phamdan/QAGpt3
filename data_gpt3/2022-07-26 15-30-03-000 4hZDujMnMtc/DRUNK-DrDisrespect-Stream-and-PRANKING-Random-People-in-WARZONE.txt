 Hi Pico, where do you want to go? Okay, go ahead and mark it. Oh, you beat me to it. How about to that buy zone? We'll get our load out. I'm about to go down! Wow, great shots! Two guys down the hill, right behind us. Got him! Great shot! Wow, you're a really good player. You seem like a really cool, like a really good player. Hey guys! Hey, hey snake! You ready? Yep. Have fun, okay? Ehehehe. Ehehehe. Ehehehe. Ehehehe. Sorry, I don't know where I was. I was in another dimension there, snake. All good, man. We're out of it though. And we're locked in. Hey snake, you're not taking my kills, are you? No sir. Okay. Where you at? Where you at? Alright, alright. I'm with you. I'm a little bit behind you. You're, hey, snake. You're not the only hot shot. Yep. Trust me, I ain't no hot shot. I was just working, like I was literally champs, I was working my magic. I was working my magic, and then I start sending the fucking guy that I'm playing with a whole bunch of messages, they stop, and then they, you know, you're playing with Doc, you're playing with Doctor. And it just fucking ruins everything! I'm telling you, champs, I might close down the chat for the rest of the year. I was working towards just getting this guy to really lock in with his hacks. You know? I'm chugging an IPA right now. Where's that unicorn? Alright, unicorn. Unicorn win. Unicorn win. What'd you say? Alright, I'll slow sip it then. What are you sipping on? A little citrus hot session IPA. Hey Doc, isn't it like 2.47 over there? Yeah, but the start of the week is about to happen in less than 30 minutes. It's gonna be Doc's first drunk stream. No. It's gonna take like 20 of those IPAs. I'm gonna go get some diarrhea. I feel like we're about halfway through the broadcast. That's right! Wake up! I got diarrhea, I'll be right back. William Lloyd, thank you for the $9.99. Love you, bro. Hey, bro. Love you, bro. If you get a shirt. Hey, bro. Is anyone watching right now from the team? Nobody's watching. Nobody's watching. Nobody's watching. Nobody's watching. Right up there. Sweet. This guy is about to get wrapped up real quick, man. Alright. Be good! No! God. Slow down! Slow down! Okay, we're up 37 feet. So we're gonna, um, potentially bump it up. Move five iron. Let's get a nice flop. A lot of people don't like the flop. I do. I do. And let me show you why. Let me show you why I like the flop. Especially with 68%, 75%. Put a little backspin on this bad boy. Let me show you why I like the flop. You ready? I gotta get some birdies. I'm gonna get some birdies going here. Come on, let's finish this out. This guy. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Whoa, whoa. I still got a shot at it. You gotta bend it though. You're gonna have to bend it. I'm gonna go like this. And I'm gonna kind of curve it around. Okay. Sweet. Sweet. All right. Let's go up three on this guy and really call it. Make him quit. A trickle in! Woo! I still want a birdie though. Ooh, do we go for it? Down four feet, up 17 feet on the other side. We just absolutely smash it. Off this hill. Get some momentum going up. Why not? Why not? Hit the hill. Ah! Oh, you played it soft. Would you have a little five iron? That's a cute shot. That's a cute shot. You know what the big difference is? Shots like this. Shots just like that. That's the difference. That's the difference, Hastie. You see what I'm saying? Look at the multi-million dollar smile. That's the difference. Got that off the list. What's next? Fall guys time, doc. Let's go. When you have people like Courage and Timmy having seven, eight YouTube channels, like what content can you do? What content can you do? Nothing I can do. What do you mean? Just make more channels. I might make a third one and call it Tim's other channel. Dude, you should have a channel for when you react to TikTok. Timmy the Tap Man 2. Yes. Okay. Food TikTok. You got a YouTube channel, Tim the Tap Man 2. Then I got more Timmy the Tap Man. Then I got Timmy the Tap Man 5. Doc's going to be laughing. I'm going to be laughing. Doc's going to be letting down videos and I'm starting a more Z-Laner channel. It makes sense because you get some stuff like this fall guys show. It does. How does that not make sense, doc? We have enough content in this world for subpar reaction videos. Holy shit. All right, here we go. You're such a fucking boomer. Oh my god. Now I can't get my gun, bro. Now it's rocked. Thank you for stealing that from me. It's fine. Another one. Try to steal that from me if you can. There you go. There you go. What is this fucking game? What is this fucking game? Now, because you can see me all the way through the walls, huh? Can you do that little sparkle boom boom? Now you just can follow me all the way around. Let's get back to the real map here. This is just like I'm playing team death match. I mean, doc, correct me if I'm wrong. We had the bank games and you go, how about some resurgence? I just needed to mix it up. I needed to mix it up. You were the one. I know. And rightfully so, right? Because I would have kept on losing brain cells. Sometimes just switching it up is like a nice reset. I've got my reset. I'm ready to go back to Caldera. I'm ready to put up 25 while Timmy goes 13 and goes, get me up, bro. I don't sound like that. You know that? Yeah, you do actually ready. Get me up, bro. Hit the bye zone. Hit the bye, bro. Why are you? Why is your pitch of me so low? Why? Why? Why? Timmy, we're back on the island. I was dodging three servers. I was dodging three servers. I'll be right back. I was dodging. I was dodging strange diapers. My fault. That's not right. That's not right. See what I'm saying though, is you usually pitch me down. You're like, I know, give me a bro. I don't sound like that. Sometimes I do. Hey, bro, low key, bro. Thank you for the $20 donation. I'm a 5'5 Doc watching while eating dinner. Will you tell my three-year-old son Wyatt to eat his Hulk beans so he can be big and strong like the doctor disrespect. Hey, Wyatt. Look at me right now, Wyatt. I'm looking right at you. Yeah, that's right. Look at your dad now. Is this real or is this not? Yeah, go ahead and look at your dad. And then look right back at me. Is this real? Hey, TV Wyatt. What you're gonna do, if you haven't done so already, because I can't tell, I don't have the angle, but you're gonna eat all those beans and you're gonna be strong, ripped, and incredibly handsome, just like the two-time. Enjoy.
