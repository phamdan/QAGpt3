We're playing Bobby Poff right now. Hey Bobby, I'm showing up in the 1990 Lamborghini Diablo VT. I'm grabbing the vest and I'm ripping it off. I'm taking it home and then I'll mel it back to you. Cause I feel bad. Doc said he's taking that vest from you if you win and he's giving it to you. Hey, I'm ripping that vest right off the wall Bobby. Doc, it's literally in a bank in Switzerland bro. I can't even access it for the next 30 years. I don't know what to tell you. Listen, I know the password because, I mean, Astro and I, we flip phone each other every day. That's true, I know. My mistake, Mr. Doc. Nice! I'm taking it home and there's a lot of team coming up. Both of them are mine D. It's ready to go. Boom! I have no ammo. Last one, one shot is gone. I'm top. In above us.

Can't be shot unless you have me on your 6 monitor, you fat... Launching Battlegrounds? Done. Got you. No, you're not. How did that happen the other day? We courage them. Was this random? I think what happened is I was running... There's some mode on Steam called like Steam Game Mode or Big Mode or something. Yeah. And it's like using your controller to navigate through Steam and launching games from Steam. So that's what I did. But apparently it stays on in the background when you go to mouse and keyboard. And something crosses over where while you're playing the game, you're also navigating the UI within Steam. And I think that's what happened when I launched Battlegrounds. You got some crazy shit going on. The Halo controller thing with the thumbsticks. My God, brother. Some crazy stuff going on over there. Alex needs a wake up. F*** off! Yeah! On Monday we had a little tease. A little QR code that I created off a mobile device called my flip phone. The same one. And if you scanned it, it took you to a special Discord. Undiscussed. On Tuesday, the biggest announcement of the 2x career. We are officially announcing our gaming studio. Triple A gaming studio called Midnight Society, man. And I am excited. Yeah! I'm excited. You can follow us on Twitter at 12am. Let me bring that up. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. There was the announcement. Midnight Society going live. Little video. I mean, I don't even want to... Where you are... You're all gonna die. I've already... I've already fired two audio guys. That's kind of... I'm running into an issue, champs. I've already fired two guys. Legend, thank you for the 50-50 in Super Chat. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... That's a lot of money and that's... That's just too much money to not say anything, Legend. You gotta say something. Right? Because sometimes I want to feel a certain way. Legend, you've got to say something when you're looking at me. Legend. Oh, Legend. You've got to say something. Legend, oh, Legend. You know you've got to say something. Huh? You know you've got to say something. Okay. Legend, oh, Legend. Oh girl, you got me tethered. I can't stop thinking about you. And I can't stop thinking about you. I can't stop thinking about you and me. I don't know much. Baby, baby, baby.
