We gotta go this way. This way. And this way. Tim can you fucking wake up? Holy shit Timmy. Wake up. We're fucking busy. Slow the fuck down Timmy. Take a deep breath. I couldn't even imagine being in a building with you. Let's say if we ever like we do meet up ever. Let's say if I go to Florida and we go out to some sort of bar that's on the beach right there. But the bar catches on fire and we're in the middle of it. I don't want to be near you Timmy. Because it feels like you'd just panic all the way to your death. I'd run right through a wall that's not on fire and get the fuck out. Like the juggernaut. How about a collapsing building? And we're both dead. No I'm getting out. No you're not. Oh trust me because I'm using my mind. And my athleticism. It doesn't matter how strong your mind is if a building's collapsing on you. That's the end of it. But the problem is you'd be trying to hold on to my leather jacket pulling me back. It's like because you're panicking. Just slow down. That's all I'm saying. Slow down your mind.

Come on baby they always want a peek. 1v3 for the dub. Please. Come on now baby. I'm not gonna lie I could like kill my forearm right there man. I am pressing as hard as I can on my right thumb stick. I don't know why but it just feels like I need to. To sprint around all the time. Ready baby. Doc! Good morning! Wake up! Jesus! You kept saying where are we and we were thinking where are you? Man. Where were you guys? How's the controller feel? We were here. Right here. You must have left the Discord at some point. I probably. I get it though. I've been terrorizing people on shipment and DOS house for the last hour and a half. I'm feeling good. You guys aren't tired like your thumbs aren't like I just played half a game on shipment. My right hand is exploding. Oh no we're controller players at birth so. Playing on controller. I will say my arm hurts when I play mouse and keyboard. So it goes both ways. Okay so it's kind of like dunking. You get the calluses around your hands. Hanging on the rim. Yeah. Got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like dunking. I haven't had those calluses in years. Yeah. I mean. So I better be weird now. Are you so you are playing on controller though. Mouse and keyboard. There's no way man. Wait Doc I gotta know are you in a Call of Duty clan. No. What will it take to make you the fourth member of the TSD clan. Because right now there's only three and you're looking you're listening to them. You have no. What are they. What are they called. Are they called clans. Yeah they're called. Yeah they change. It used to be regiments but they changed it to clans. So what is the like. What's the information around that. Why. Why. Would you. I mean what does it do. It gives you a goal. So if you ever see like a gold clan tag in game that is because it's like it's like O.G. Xbox tags you get. Make multiple clans with the same name. And I mean in terms of like what does it actually do like what are the suits up in Activision like trying to make it do. There's like happy hour X.P. and stuff like that. So it's like a clan members between 8 and 10 p.m. We've got double XP. So make sure to get on. You need four to make a clan. Is what you're saying. I mean I could I could use. Yeah. Nice. You need. Yeah. So how do I do that. I'll I'll I'll handle it. OK. I mean again my ego is so sky high. I don't even have time to you know. Yeah. Try to figure it out. I feel like you just sold them some insurance. Yeah. I will handle it. Don't worry about no blackout dates. We got pretty good vision and dental stock options. Yeah. We're working on them about that. We're working on them. We know all about stocks and their options. Don't hop into like a pub or something. I mean something. You can. Doc what's your stash routine.
