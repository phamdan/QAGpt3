 I'm here to hear about advanced warfare 2. Like I'm not too happy with Z right now. Right here! Mantula! October contest is here. Little known fact, behind the scenes dev stuff. When I first designed this... Z's on early. Like I'm not too happy with Z right now. I gotta be honest, let me tell you. I flip phoned him and Niko last night, given it was last night and it was a little bit later. Z says absolutely. I'm like alright let's do it. Niko, same, let's do it. But Z's like I got a hard cut off time. I don't know if he said hard cut off time, I might be adding a little couple extra words to that. But he had planned on playing with Courage and Tanner for Apex. Whoa. Sorry Z, I'll take a step back. So here's what I'm thinking, when Z leaves us, Niko and I, we go out and find an incredible third all the way. Morning, I don't even want to mess around. Good morning. I actually would like to get into it because I was in your stream, Doc, and I'm not going to take this shit today. This man, hey champs, real quick, let's clear the air. What? This man called, this guy flip phones Niko and I at probably like what, 10 o'clock my time. I've already got plans for my Monday, Doc. It actually sounds like you just don't want to play with Niko in the two times. And maybe even the two times. I want to commit to it and I want to have a serious session and the mind starts with it. Because I hope you're not giving me this explanation because you feel as if I locked in a session with Courage and Tanner all due to the fact of your performance. That's not true, Doc. I, you know what? I wasn't thinking that at all, but now that you said it out loud. As long as you don't lose your internet connection over there. Can you hear me? Yeah, you're fine. You're fine for me. Okay. All right. Doc, maybe, hey, hopefully you don't- You guys are gaslighting each other. Hopefully you don't lose power over there to get the answer. I don't know what Alex is doing, but- Chance, am I tripping? Does he sound like- Are you not hearing this? Let's get locked in guys. I mean, I'm locked in. Niko was talking about it earlier. I know Niko's locked in. I'm not sure, Z. Not yet. He's like, Z, I'm in Courage probably right now. I'm so locked in! Do you really want to ditch this how it dysfunctional team? Yeah, we're going deep tonight, man. I think a lot of people are thinking that Z made plans with Doc and Niko and now he's leaving them. That is not true. That is not true. Everyone should know that that is not true. That's literally how it is. I locked in players with Courage and Tanner, and then I told you boys, I got till 4 PM today. I got till 4 PM today. But- Wait, 4 PM your time? No, no, no, that's your time. That's your time, right? Well, that's in another three hours. Yeah. Oh wait, what? Yeah, yeah. So you got another three hours with us then, if that's the case. No, no, no. Okay, no, no, no. I'm wrong. I'm wrong. All right, good. We're locked in for three hours. Here we are. No, no, no, you're right. Mic check. Microphone check. One, two. Mic check. Mic. Microphone check. Mic check. One, two. Microphone check. One, two. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't care where you're from. Guadalajara, Mexico. Canara, Australia, Mike. Portugal, Brazil, and Alaska, and the islands of Hawaii. I don't care where you're from. I need you to be trickling inside of the arena right now. Get to your seat. Grab your- Carne asada con queso. Grab your Mountain Dew game fuel. Today's not the day we fuck around. It's all about passion. That's easy. Get the fuck out of the game. It's about getting to the tippity-top. Come on, baby! Let's go! And we're really only halfway up. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. What the fuck? Such a serious session today. You're gonna take all this stuff on these pills? Three time, all that stuff? Oh, never mind. Never mind. Hey guys, take your time. Are you guys gonna crap first? Take your time. I'm just a little guy in a portal that just wants to play some video games. What the- Yeah! Now we're talking. I ran right to him. Ah, right here. Man, right here. Man, it's locked. Oh my god, man. God, man, you're really playing the game like that? No one wants the ballistic shield. Nobody. I almost want to back out. Delete this game. I do. How is this guy? Thank you.

And like, trust me, I'd like, would you guys be happy to? Him and Nico last night. What's Kurt saying? Is he getting all pissed off? Oh, good, Z. You do your thing, man.

Tons of prizing, tons of good looking costumes, tons of athleticism. If you've got the guts, come get involved, baby. Come get involved. I'm here to hear about Advanced Warfare 2. I don't know anything. I don't have any inside information, Timmy. I was just going to provide my whole entire thoughts on the franchise and the IP. And let's just really say what we really want to say. They've been listening to the two time. It's pretty apparent. How long have we been saying Advanced Warfare 2 will come back? I'll tell you right now, the suits and ties are listening. I've always been three or four years ahead of the rotation of games that they got going on. I really have been. Timmy, welcome to the Champions Club. Thank you for subscribing. Welcome. First month beginner, get to know the other Champions Club members. Good to have you, Timmy. Timmy might think I'm a psycho. I mean, this is a good looking game, don't you think? Man, this game's got a cool vibe. Just imagine what an Advanced Warfare 2 Battle Royale experience could be like. I think because the movement's so athletic and fluid like this, I think you would see more dense areas that were designed for the mechanics. I know we had the frustrating downtown area in Warzone on Verdansk. But imagine a more dense downtown that had more flexibility and ramps and fucking, and it goes even more vertical and shit. That's what I would build Advanced Warfare 2. More verticality in Advanced Warfare 2. Like multiplayer? Little known fact. You want to know a little known fact about this map? Behind the scenes dev stuff. When I first designed this, it's like from a fictional standpoint, it's like a space elevator. So I was thinking when I designed this just from a top down perspective, I originally designed it where the actual elevator wasn't here. Because at this time, we're thinking like, what are map events, like big map events that can happen? And so you play half the map with this elevator, not in this space. Very similar padding, but it is wide open. So it's like a very wide open, long sight line pathway. It starts out and then you see this big, huge elevator. And it's a big event. You hear the sirens, moving objects and shit. This thing raises up, and it fucking locks in from a technical standpoint. It was really hard to hit a performance bar with the event. So we decided to scrap it. Because it changed the dynamic of how the map played like halfway through. Like literally that lane was kind of like a high risk, high reward lane with a long sight line, no cover. And then all of a sudden that whole lane just changes and does like a 360. When are they talking? 2025? Sledgehammer games coming off Vanguard. Doc Might design maps for Advanced Warfare 2. Hey, if the flip phone rang and if they said something like, hey, you wanna design a map, they wanna do something. Like I'd be all for it, man. Let's take a look at Recovery. I had this map built. So the whole concept of this map originally was to have, like you start in one sector and then you get pushed into another sector. The fiction at the time, I can't remember what it was. It was like some sort of outdoor downtown area. And then you get pushed into this warehouse or something. I can't remember what it was, but it somehow transitioned into a volcano and the volcano erupts. And then you get forced to the outside of the volcano and you're fighting through that hole. That's what it turned into. The original design for this map was before Boost Jump. So when Boost Jump came on, we had to like go back into all of our maps and redesign and change geo. So, which ultimately you're not really originally building for the new player mechanics in mind from the very beginning. But I think we did a pretty good job in adapting and going back in and making the appropriate changes. And God, this game looks good, man. And I'm... Huh? This game looks good. Retreat. What a great map design. I think Retreat has to be one of the better ones that fit the mechanics. I think the spacing and the metrics and all sort of just fell right into it. They wanted this map in the game. They wanted to make a clown map. At this point, I was like, man. But actually I was like, I wanted to take it on. It went through a lot of like different iterations. Like I'll make a layout and the layout was completely changed. It was literally just supposed to be like, what is Advanced Warfare's version of Nuketown? You know? Are you going to say anything about Advanced Warfare 2 that hasn't been leaked yet, bro? Timmy, I got nothing. It's just my opinion. Can I get a damage check, Doc asked. Selfishly, I'll say 1215 was the most that lobby. Okay, Courage. Typically it is Niko and Z. But that game, it was me. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Damage check them, baby. I don't wanna be that guy, but I'm actually pretty sure if you combine Niko and Z's damage, I had more than both of them combined. But that's typically the other way around. I'm not gonna rub it in. Yeah, I wouldn't either. I don't know if Niko and Z wanna comment on how well I played there. It kinda sounds like you're trying to rub it in. No, no, no, listen. 3X made me do that. So it would have been possible without it. Guys, can I talk? Z, can I talk for a second? That's like Doc damage checking with a charge rifle. See what I mean? Yeah, but it's part of the game. Being a great support player, you are a great support player. You are the Robin and I'm Batman. Thank you for being a friend. You're Robin, I'm Batman and Niko's Catwoman. Uh-oh. I don't like that. All right. And Doc's the Joker. Yo, Sir Roger. Because that motherfucker shoots like a clown, you know what I'm saying? All right, that's enough. I'm getting that off of you. I'm getting that off of you. I'm getting that off of you. I'm getting that off of you. I'm getting that off of you. I'm getting that off of you. I'm getting that off of you. We can do whatever we want. That's the beauty of it, champs. That's the beauty of it, champs. We can do whatever we want. We can do whatever we want. Hello, boys and girls. I'm Mickey Mouse.
