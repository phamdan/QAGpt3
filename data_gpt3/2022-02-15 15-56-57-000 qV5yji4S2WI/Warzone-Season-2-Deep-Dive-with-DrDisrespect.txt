 Warzone Season 2 Holy shit! Oh, that's a... AI! OHH! WOOOOOAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH That's... Oh, look at that skit! How about the invisible head bundled up? The arena's... WIDE OPEN! And we're jumpin' in. With a brand new Call of Duty Warzone... Season 2... On Caldera. Is that the official title or...? I can't wait to jump on the brand new map. I can't wait to play on West Coast servers. I can't wait to try out all the new snipers. And most importantly, I can't wait... For the brand new state-of-the-art directional audio... Re-engineering. We're gonna find out if this new season can retain our attention. Because if it can't, I'm out and I'm jumping right on Escape from Tarkov, I'm telling you. But we'll see, we'll see. What do we have here? Warzone. So these are the official patch notes from Raven. Let's, uh... Let's go over them. Call of Duty Warzone Season 2 lands with new content and quality of life improvements across the board. Prepare for some heavy weaponry in all of the following. New gameplay features! Nebula V ammo and bombs create new offensive tactics! While portable decamp... Enough of that, enough of that, enough of that. Uh, AI threats. Don't even want to read the rest of this sentence. New vehicle! The bomber plane is a formidable... Okay. Bombers can also destroy loadout drops, which can fundamentally change how operators approach these powerful sources of weapons. That's an interesting design, Tate. That's an interesting... I bet this vehicle's kind of fun to play. You know, you just fly around, just drop bombs. You get four bombs in the, uh, bomber. Are you in the bomber? I am. I'll drop a bomb right on your building if needed. You got two guys right next to you. Yeah, here's this thing you could bomb other people's, um, loadout. Loadout stuff, yeah. Whoa, boom, boom! I got you, Z! I'm going right through a balloon. Easy. Boom, boom, boom! Boom, boom, boom! Boom, boom, boom! Yeah! So I wonder if, like, if you get in the plane, does it mark people's loadout? That could be interesting. I would assume so. How does it reload? Oh, it just reloads on its own? Oh, okay. So that yellow thing, is that a loadout? Boom, boom, boom! Oh! Oh, you're coming down! Well, let's go back! Oh, yeah, get him, get him! Get him, brother! Drop in here on this guy you got knocked. Please drop some bombs on his head, brother. Watch out for those fucking trees! Dude, let's go! Hey, that bomber's kind of nice. Dead silence removed. Ungrained, removed. UAVs removed from the buy station. UAVs are available as contract rewards. It's about time, man. I'm tired of these controller players. Like, they get stunned, they push in, the guy still fucking locks on you. With steps of spectators are less audible. Good. Increased mantle height for improved vertical navigation and traversal. All right. Wow, no recoil on this weapon. You being sarcastic, you guy? What is this thing right here, Doc? PDS field upgrade. I'm gonna put it down. All right. So, I'm assuming if we had people around us, maybe that would, like, do something to them? All right, I'm gonna check out this balloon here. I don't think we've ever seen this in any other game. I'm some really new cool design they're adding right here. That's pretty sick. I like that. I like that. Be cool if you can go back to it. Just like in Apex. Wow, this is just a straight up like... This is just straight up Apex balloon, huh? Come this way. Nice. Holy shit! Oh, that's an AI. Oh, not real at all. Oh, look at that skid. How about the invisible head bundled up? I'm going with it. Oh, shit. Do you see his head? Was it invisible? Yeah, it's invisible, I think. No, Doc! Did you find a new invisible skin? Oh, no. No headshots, man. Hey, welcome to my YouTube channel. Please like the video. Subscribe. Subscribe to the channel. Hey, we're going to be checking out this new skin from season two. Bundled up. Anyways, I'm not very good at these intros. I get more excited about discovering a bug than I do playing the game. Before we launched the game in the browser, we downloaded the update. What's the likelihood this game is going to ask us that we need a restart? Look at this. We got the updated season two. No restart? Updated season two background. I got no gun. I have a pistol. Another one to his left. Right here. Oh, my. Hey, this is like 100. The other one that I knocked. Let's get some action. Got his chopper. He deleted this guy. Nice! Come on, baby. No, Marty, pass! I'm fucking death dead! John, if you stay alive, I can spawn back in. You just have to survive with the ground. Bro, I got it, bro. Oh, bro, I got it. I got it. He said, oh, he's fucking with me. All right, listen, if you're around for the rest of the week, you let me know. I'll be I mean, I'll hit you up. I just you're such a busy, you know, you're such a busy person. I don't want to I'll slide in those DMS. I'll slide in there. Listen, there's deals and then there's executive deals. Yeah. Okay. Think about it. Tell me about those executive deals. What do those look like? They're just there's like getting to the top of the building and then getting to the rooftop. I don't know how else to describe it. Yeah. No, I kind of get you. It's like walking on marble floors and then walking on marble floors that are heated. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Dude, heated floors are like they hit different. They're something else, man. There's nothing like waking up and you going to there. We have one heated floor in our house. It's in the bathroom of the master bedroom. You heat that bad boy up, you go in there in the morning, especially when it's cold here out in Kentown. it's cold here out in Canada, you know what I mean? Yeah, I can imagine. Oh, it's nice. All right, man, you enjoy the rest of your day. I'll talk to you later in the week if you want to run any. All right, Z. All right, brother. Enjoy, man. Enjoy, man. Thank you. You too. Boom! Boom! No! Ah! Send me an invite if you can. I backed up. Not playing that fucking game. Stupid-ass log. Jesus. I'm out of that lobby. You don't say. What happened? Honestly, it all happened in a flash. I'm out of here. That right here? Damn, this thing hits. Sure to like, subscribe. I see them. They're kind of on that. I see them. Boom, down, of course, AX50 doing the job, getting the job done. Ooh, another one. Another one right here. I got one of them. That's both of them. Dirtiest angle on this guy, I'm gonna fucking shoot him in the head. One shot. Boom, down, of course, I'm the best. Timmy turns this Jeep in the wrong direction so many times, you should call him Timmy Turner. He's pushing in from your right. No! Nice call out, Timmy. I'm like. All right, I'm moving on to the next one. MP7 AMAX loadout, Timmy. Alrighty then, Doc, looking forward to seeing that. All right, like and subscribe if you can, fuck. I'm thinking about cooking something. Little barbecue Spanish rice with some mushrooms in it. Maybe we do get some nice tender steaks, perhaps even chicken. Maybe we'll get a nice organic salad going, you know? Freshly cut tomatoes and everything. I mean, I could do all this. Little avocado, oil and vinegar. Little glass of wine. I don't know, I'm just talking out loud. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
