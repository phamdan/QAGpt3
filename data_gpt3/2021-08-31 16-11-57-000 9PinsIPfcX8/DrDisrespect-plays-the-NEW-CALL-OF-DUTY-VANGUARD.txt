Yeah, they have four of these, four of these little maps right now, but I feel like, I feel like in this, you could churn these out, you know? Easily man. I've already got, I've got, I've got 25 designs in the back of my mind. I'm just going to take them out of my head right now, Courage. Damn, I wish I could use them, but they just definitely can't afford them. I dock most of the champions club isn't happy about this alpha. What's your initial feeling after playing? And what do you think needs immediate attention? Much love says ConeMarvelous with a 499. I think the concept for this game mode is cool. It's fun. It's one of those things though. Where does it eventually, it's kind of like the 2v2, you know, that they've done like the 1v1 and the 2v2 and the 3v3. You kind of play it, you feel it out for a little bit. It's cool. And then it's like, what's the bigger agenda? I got a feeling this is what this will fall under. Unless there are elements that are sort of integrated into the battle royale portion or the multiplayer portion. I don't know how that, what that integration looks like, but I don't know if there's a rank system, if that's even interesting enough. My thoughts on the game mode is it's cool. It's cool. It's cool. I'm fucking ripped from head to tippy toe. Six foot eight. The gaming great. Vanier than I've ever been. Alex, hide the screen, fucking mute the game. We need to get a win. Way faster. Like you, you're not even fucking close to me. That dude, I mean, I'm talking not even close man. Not even. That guy's going, what the, what, who is this guy? Okay. I won't say anything else. What do you mean I'm going to die right here? I got to die here. Nobody's on the bridge. Come on man. You got to believe baby. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I hear the guy's sniping. What do you want me to do about it? Well, I can't run him over. I mean, I've got another car chasing me. Well, maybe we'll get involved. Maybe we'll kill this guy. There's a chance. I don't think so. I got to go. I got to go. I got to. I've been driving fast my whole entire life. Ever since the day I was born, I was on a whole other level. The dark alleyways, the ponytail whipping, the all black leather. This is the reality check that people need. And this is the reality check I'm willing to provide. You get your chance. You know what I'm saying? Boom. Bye pussy. These fucking guys, they get one shot and that's it. Just absolutely fooled them on that. On the other side of the mountain. They somehow snuck through. Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby. We need to get a win. We need to get a win. I'm not necessarily the ending I was expecting, especially dedicating 20 minutes of my time getting to that point of the game. Good energy today, champs. Must be the hair. Must be the black steel. This thing, this is really... Oh, my God. Oh my god, no. Like how does that... How does... This guy's standing right here! Boom, how about that? Oh, I switched my weapon, huh? Enemy UAV overhead! Dude, this game, oof. Boom, there you go. Underneath, underneath the fucking... Right side, champ, underneath. What a... There's an enemy tank, I'm... Yeah, you're kind of in trouble now, aren't you? Huh? You're kind of in trouble. There you go, orange boxes, perfect. Yep, you knew where the boxes... Whoa, whoa, hold on, let me see this guy. Oh, he just... got it. I jumped up there to challenge his fucking sniper, he was ADS. I knew he was just... Boom, not a very good challenge, this guy. He's the type of guy you just kind of go right at, right? He's the guy you just go right at, you know? You challenge him, you look him in his eyes, no cover, nothing, you just kind of challenge him. What the hell? Pretty top level competition here, champs. I don't know if you've noticed this, but... Did you see the doctor? He's right up on the hill. Why would you give your position away like that, doctor? Huh? Why would you give your position away like that, doctor? I've been doing this for years. Oh, that jukie play. Wait, wait. I've got three other players left. You ain't on my level! Oh, baby, baby, baby. Wow! Man, that was one of the sweatiest lobbies I've ever been. I hope you're watching that, Z-Man, huh? Wow, what a loser. I mean, these guys are slide canceling. I mean, I felt like I was in a professional tournament for $250,000. That's what it looked like. I need it now, here, quickly! Get to the chopper now! Hurry! Dylan. You son of a bitch. What's the matter? CIA got you pushing too many pencils? I made it on his stream! I finally made it on his stream! I finally made it on his stream! I'm in his game! God, it's PUBG! I got it installed on my computer, and I'm actually in his game. I'm going to land right where he's going to land, and I'm going to rotate to him, and I'm going to grab my truck and my car, and I'm going to beep my horn all around him until he notices me. And then I'm going to tell my friends, look at, bro, I'm going to just disrespect stream. And they're all going to laugh. I'm going to post it on TikTok, and if it's really, really funny, like really, really, really funny, and if like a car explodes by him, or if a plane crashed him, or if it's like he's in the red zone and he dies in the red zone, then it might even make Reddit. And if it makes Reddit, do you know my credibility in my school? How cool I'd be? God, I would be the most popular kid in my computer science class. It's going to make my day. It's going to make my week. It's going to make my month. Oh, you know what? I've been having a bad time lately. It'd probably make my whole year. God, man.
