 An 8.8 to 8.9. We're taking Dadallion on a world tour in Elden Ring. And then we're getting back locked in onto the main quest. I look good. I feel good. I smell good. And so do you. This is Shasty with the 499, Pixel with the 499. Hey Doc, love the Elden streams. Keep them coming. Would you call this game active? Does it live up to the standards? Would love to see some valorant. I feel like you kind of partially turned into a robot there at the end. You're going through some firmware upgrader. Oh, the atmosphere throws me right in, man. Alright, let's figure out what we need to do here. We went to the north. That's exactly where we're at. We're climbing this thing. Is it worth it? That's the question. I just want to see what this looks like. Man, they got to make sound effects for you. They got to give you the opportunity to even customize more in games. I'm talking sound effects, everything. I love these games, man. It kind of gives me a little bit of that Elder Scrolls vibe. You know, in terms of like, you just don't know where this is going. You don't know where you're going. Like, you don't know what you're going to run into. The element of surprise and... Where is this guy? Huh? That's a fucking dragon. Hey, get out of there! Get out! No! Get back over here. Get back over here. Fuck. Get him out! Easy! You need dexterity and... Man, it's like, the weapons that I'm getting right now. No, so we're just going to... Just kind of make sure we're heading north. We're heading in the right way. Jumping required ahead. Yeah, it doesn't look like it. Almost got me! If I didn't see that bloodstain, I might have challenged it. I might have challenged it. All right, where's this big dragon? I guess the question is, do we just... Do we take from this dragon? Ah! Oh, shit. We got to do something about this guy. I mean, what am I fucking swinging at? Dude, my camera, I am going to go nuts. It looks like a cool boss. Dragon. What's this? Oh, shit. That's the dude, huh? That's the... Look at this guy's... Yeah! How about this one? There you go. Missed two of them. Three. This guy uses his boat. Where'd your little boat go? Did it? Did it? Did it? Did it? Did it? Did it? Did it? Did it? Did it? Did it? Did it? Did it? Ah, you're the fast one, aren't you? I'm going to find you. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to find you. Where are you? I can hear you. I can hear you. You can't hide from the... You can't hide from the two-time. Where are you? How are you going to hide? You're going to hide from the two-time. Oh, you got a good hiding spot. You do. You got a great hiding spot. It's not going to be enough though when I find you. It's not going to be enough. Alright, we're way out here now. Any monuments you... still? No? It must be... it must be way out here. You almost snuck by me. Hey, this little spot almost snuck by the two-time. You had a chance. Dude, I'm at the fucking ladder and I'm spamming why. I am literally sitting there spamming why. And the guy's not moving. You know? He's not moving at all. The world of Elden Rings. We scuffled. We suffocated. We squeezed. And we fought through it. Now, it's about getting inside of this dungeon. One step at a time. All the way to the finish line. One step at a time. All the way to the finish line. One step at a time. All the way to the finish line. Let's do this just easily. What a weird creature. Dude, stop man. Stop. Get up. Dude! Don't get greedy. Yeah, get greedy. Third try? Second try or third try? Too much rrrrroops. I had 30,000 going in here. I came out with 12,000. To me, that wasn't a good deal. We got sidetracked. Simple as that. We certainly have to go back to that site. It's something I've been wanting to check out. And I know you guys have been curious as to what's over there. I meant to jump off my horse on this. I could slice you, and then dice you, and then rip you, and make you understand the stamina, then the power. Boom. And this is where we get rid of you. Kick you off the... Before we continue up here, I know a lot of you are going to be saying, Doc, stop backtracking. I am... I literally am going to go right up in here. Let's go. We're going right to the top. Or whatever this place is. Alright, we've arrived. The place that I've been wanting to go. I'm getting sidetracked. It doesn't matter. I'm hungry. Full salad right to my left. Only a true gamer eats pieces of their green screen, says Attack Horse with a $4.99. Super weird to say. Don't know what you're talking about. Look at this thing. Yeah, my camera got all fucked up. The camera is secretly a boss. I feel like that's what it is. Oh yeah, that's a great, great idea. That's the hotkey we're looking for. Maybe we'll get this boss then on the back right. What we're going to do, get this boss? We can do it. Not a problem. Yeah, take your time. Holy shit. Steak of Marika. Let's get the steak of Marika. Steak of Marika. Steak of Marika. Steak of Marika. Steak of Marika. Alright. I started figuring out at the end. It's just roll, roll, roll to Loretta. This place is just massive, huh? What a massive world. I mean, very impressive world design. Whoa. I guess we're going to the castle. Is this where I need to go? Look at this place. Yeah. This place looks sick. We got to go there, man.
