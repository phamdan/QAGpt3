How much did you drink last night? Yeah, hot dogs, listen, that's not really the point. Point is, we had a good time. There is a way, Doc, to get specialist off spawn. I want to do that. Chat, you get the key card at bio and you take it where, Stronghold, and you open that thing and you're guaranteed specialist. Okay. Chat, where is the key card in bio? Oh, Timmy, I didn't know you're gonna- That's a big question. That is the big question. Where is that key? The basement shower. Okay, got it. What's in the basement shower? Do I need to go check? Is it flooded? I'm gonna try and go there pre-game right here. I'm just gonna go find it. You think you have time then? If you have time to go to the, listen, champs. When's the last time you've stopped by the- Go to the bio basement and you pull the shower handle. What's really happening in our showers, man? I got the card. I got the card. All right.

And a loading. Dude, this is crazy. Oh. I'm not gonna play anything else right now. Our whole squad gets fucking specialist and our loading. Are you coming down? Serious? If that's how I lost my specialist, bro, I would have maybe never played with you again. No, I was three feet above the ground. I'm in a blender. Jesus, get in your hand. Oh my God. Oh.

You believe in my play right now? I don't. You just gotta believe. I need you to. That's what happens. You, dog, it's like, you know, are you okay? Yeah, a little bit. What's going on, man? I feel like we should be flying around in Fortnite. Let's go, let's go. We're gonna play Fortnite. Unless you really wanna get the specialist win. Have we gotten a specialist win? We have not gotten a specialist win. Okay, that's what we gotta do. Let's go. Let's go. Let's do it. Next game, next game. Come on. What's in? One shot, one shot. What? Okay, back it up, reload it. No. No counter-bots for the chop either. You're just fucking yeeting. I mean. It was a nice shot. Come on, Timmy. They're all lined up right there. Not even looking. Give me the ripcord call, bro. Just Timmy out, I'm throwing. That's it. That's all I needed. Well, I didn't even know I was gonna throw it. What does that even mean, bro? What do you mean you didn't know you were gonna throw? It's one of those like, I'll turn left here without letting anybody know in the car. Muted in, gameplay hidden. No champs, I'm not gonna play Elden Ring right now. I got like one or two more, doc. I'm just hungry at this point, I think. I get it, I get it. Is it the real one? It is. Calm down, guys. Calm down. I repeat, I'm staying on the mission. Wait, I got the cart. I got it. Evac, Evac.

Boom, turn around, turn around. Yeah, yeah. I mean, huge. Joey and Jeff on us. We have specialists, I repeat. Timmy, Timmy, Timmy, Timmy. Not fine. How come you? It's not fine. We can't get a win, Doc. We're too old. It's, you know, I think it's important for us to look in the mirror and just realize we cannot do this anymore. He's stairs right under us, Doc. I would not push that. How do you not just push that right there? We've got one knocked. I knocked a second. Farewell. We are pushing a fucking stairwell with four people in it. You got Mofo with a $10. Doc, Timmy needs to do less whining and more winning. He's got, oh shit, my mic. He's got the two time for a teammate. No more excuses, Timmy. I wish we sucked my fucking ass, bro. This game is literally burning my brain right now. I think we checked out a while back, but we somehow, some way, we're still playing. It's insane what we're doing right now. We're defying some sort of incredible feat that I don't think anybody else has ever done. When you completely check out of a game, yet you're still playing hours later. Oh, man. Jesus. No. I'm dead. I zipped out. They decide they're gonna shoot now. 57, A-max, yeah, yeah. This is Zippy with a $3 donation. That's what I thought. I love you. That's a way. Oh, he went up top. I didn't see him go up top. The only victory I saw today was spectating Solo. Maybe these randoms will carry us, bro. Like little demons. Do not tell this guy to buy. It's annoying. Stop pinging buy stations. Come on, baby. Let's get us in. That's what I'm talking about. I had to get the job done, Timmy. This is my LG doc. I'm going off after this. We're gonna eat. Da da da. We've been doing all day. Remember, we're going back to back. Boom. Absolutely destroyed this guy. I'm gonna get away from the MP7, man. But now I'm here. Come on. Easy, huh, Timmy? Let's wake up, man. Let's run a three in a row. I'm a juvenile. I can go for another five hours. Easy. I'm going. I'm hungry. I don't know. We got to go three in a row. It's just, that's just. You'd rather just go ahead and like call it quits or you have the opportunity to three-peat. All right, three-peat. We tried. Wow. They don't got the guts. They don't got the guts. Peter, hey, we don't got the guts. Oh, we've got the guts, baby. Oh my God. It is not the true kind. They all low? There's no fucking way in hell. The answer to that is fucking no. Where's Timmy Tenders? Where's Timmy Tenders at? He's too scared to get on the mic. He ain't got the guts. Nah, he doesn't got the guts. Can I get a yeah, yeah? Yeah, yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Timmy, you got to talk to these guys. I told you, put a show on, baby. Lock it in. Where's Timmy Tenders, baby? He's been gone for the past four hours. Yeah, he's on that fucking toilet with his pants around his ankles, praying to God. All right, bro, you got one thing to apologize for. I'm hard muting you. Hard muting. You should apologize. All right, thank you. I'm just trying to get a reaction, bro. I can't wait to hear from you guys. I watch you fuckers every day, man. Thank you. Appreciate that. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Playing with the two belts. I like this guy. I'm going to hire him just to follow me around and talk about me. Down him. Keep going. I'm unlocking it right now, bro. Got special assistance. Come here. Got a guy pushing up. He just jumped off his desk. Oh, that grinds a bit more. Yeah, it does. Fuckin' Timmy. Fuckin' John. At the tippity-ta. I'm talking tippity-tippity-ta. I just broke that guy climbing. I got a nice little nade for them. Two of them. One shot. Come on, Timmy! Come on, five days! Let's go! Woo! Hey, hey, hey, nobody's better! Nobody! You're the best, guys. Holy shit, you made my year. Better shut up right now, boy. Look at those stats, Timmy. Take a look at them, man. Take a look at them. That was a good game out of you, Doc. I'm glad that it finally came. All right, I'm off. That's an incredible way to end the stream, huh, Timmy? I mean, yeah, all of a sudden, it just took us fucking choking all day, bro. Literally. I guess you don't really know how to tell a story, huh? No. Because that's exactly what we did. Go to Kai, thank you for the $49.99. Alex is in the VIP lounge bartending again. You just made the worst bourbon stout. Can you please have him escorted out until then I can stay calm and enjoy the amazing entertainment from the two times. I think you're lying to me with that $49 donation because Alex is sitting right... Alex? You guy. You're just, you're unlocked today, Doc. Tim, not now. Alex! Homie, how did this kid get up to me? Timmy, not now. I'm trying to find Alex. Oh my God, there's fucking scaffolding, dude. Jesus Christ, Timmy. I didn't know this spot was right here. Well. You love it. They say we're bad when we want it. Easy, baby. How are you gonna show that I'm bad when I want it? You are bad, Timmy. He's not cheating, bro, your ass.cribed You are terrible. Your ass. Just cause he's good, doesn't mean you're bad. You're just ass. Jimmy sucks at this game, I'm telling you. Jimmy sucks.
