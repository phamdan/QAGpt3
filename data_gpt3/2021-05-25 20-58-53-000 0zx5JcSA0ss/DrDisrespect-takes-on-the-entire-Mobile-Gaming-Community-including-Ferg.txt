 Dark alleyways is where they're gonna find us. The next game is what we're gonna get into. Yeah, this is a two-time. The next play, it's going to be a dominant. Yeah, okay. So I'm trying to figure out how to plug this iPad in. This victory... Champions Club. The Call of Duty Mobile. Warzone. It's been waiting for the two-time back-to-back. It's a little different from the flip phone. Where I can press the buttons and the snake just gets longer and longer. We're gonna talk about this brand new 80s action hero set and pack that just released. And then we're hopping into a competition, if you will. Ferg? Is it Fergie? Ferg? Ferg? G-G. Welcome to the Dawkin Ferg 80s Throwdown. We have a delightful, delightful day for you. Mavin here joined by BobbyPlays and I don't know what to expect today. We've got COD Mobile and Doc's playing a mobile game. I didn't think I'd ever see it. The one thing I will say about the mobile gaming community. There's a lot of passion, there's a lot of energy, and you gotta respect it. Doc, do you look like Rambo or does Rambo look like you? Baris with a $10 donation. You know how tall Rambo is? He's not 6'8". But what I will say about Call of Duty Mobile. Holy shit. You talk about content, man. I was blown away, man. I mean, you talk about just a lot of fun. I think Call of Duty Mobile, like the mobile community, spoiled. Let's check this out. I think there's a trailer, yeah? Into your birthday. That's easy. It goes around the headset. Your mission, eliminate enemy operators, be the first to earn 30 points. To become John McClain or Rambo, you must fill up your Fury gauge in one of three ways. Oh, gotcha. So you turn, you basically, you turn into Rambo. We've got Ferb, we've got Doc, we've got two rounds, 45 minutes each. One gonna be played on touch controls, one gonna be played on mouse and keyboard. All that matters is kills. Bobby, these guys are gonna be trying to fly and fry. Queue up for solo BR right now. Hey, check the BR in this game. Tell me I'm not telling the truth about this. Just, just so much content. Gotta go Nuketown, yeah? Where you going? Come over here, right here. Right here, right inside. Wanna enter the conversation? That's fine. Come come, come come, come come. That's what you get. That's what you get. Yeah, this way. Get Rambo! There's two of them. He's in a really tough spot in the low ground. Doc, this is what you were built for. All 40 years of your life have led to this 1v1. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. I had a nice shot. Welcome to the 80's throwdown, Ferg and Doctor. Team up and... Easy. I even touched. Alright, let's get to the safe zone. As a player. You're not getting away, proud! In the Battle Royale game, champs, there's these like objectives. If I enter this zone, you're entering a boss zone, right? He's probably gonna get destroyed. Wait. Oh! Oh, he's getting shot in the back too! He doesn't even realize he's getting shot in the back right now. He has no idea! The indicators are showing behind him! Behind you! Behind you! Yes, yes, yes, yes! That guy! Oh, what is that? Oh, the beast didn't catch up to him. Oh my gosh, he's got 28 HP right now, popping the med. I thought for sure the game was done for him right there. This guy. Oh no. This guy. Gotta load it up though, don't you? Gotta load up, don't you? No! Dude, my thumb man! It locks me in when I don't want to get locked in. No! All right, let's get into another one. Uh, we're going to launch base. Is it me or is it you? Is it you? Oh, it's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. It's you. Is it me or is this vehicle going to be OP? Don't be shy. This is how we're going to get the kills, huh? All right, let's get out. Thinking, huh? What you thinking? Eight other players left, champs. Already in the top ten once again. You get behind the rock! Oh, leave it to Doc to die at the time. How many did he have? How many did he have? They both probably had around nine, eight, nine somewhere there. I think Furry had eight toward the end. I think Doc had nine. Furry had nine. They might have had nine. So, yeah, only 14 kills. They both played that game out. So nine kills for Doc, nine kills for Ferg. Doc is already as good as Ferg. I mean, yeah, that is definitive proof that they're 100% on the same skill level, and there's no way to debate it. 100%. No, you would not think that unless you literally did nevies. Yeah, and obviously now we're going to get ready to hop in the mouse and keyboard section of the game. I'm not going to lie, Doc did a lot better than I expected him to do. I kind of expected for there to be at least two games where he died, like within the first three people, but he definitely held his own. There are some solid gunfights in there. All right, let's get in, champs. It's a whole nother ball game right here, man. Doc, one of the greatest ever to winning championships in video games. Before video games existed. Now mouse and keyboard ready to dominate. I can't fire. Won't right click for me. He's going to be able to write the tutorial all over again. Doc's going to kill me, by the way. I've been roasting him, but I love Doc. I love him the most. He's an incredible man. But I think he got to figure it out. Now this is where champions are formed. This is where you back up all the smack talk. You come in, you drop a bomb. Again, all right. You're getting so close, Doc. There we go. He landed a shot, pulls out the exit. Grab the 360, 360. That's what you get. Let's see if I have a mini map right now. He's going to come through there. And all right, the aim is starting to look a little bit clearer. See anybody. I don't even hear him. I don't even hear him. That these mobile gamers are so easy. This is so easy. Immediately, he gets flashed in the face right there. He's got nine kills. Oh, that would have been a clip. Let me 360 this guy. This is where we're having some fun. I'm glad to see you having fun, Doc. Are you looking at me? There we go. There we go. That was actually kind of clean. I was not expecting that. Vintage Doc. It is night and day now. All these poor mobile gamers, man, just getting absolutely destroyed by the two times. One versus one. The two time. And Larry, who just finished his shift at Home Depot. Nice. Come on. There we go. Show what you're capable of. That don't suck. Oh, he's got the shotgun. Yes, maybe right over this mountain. Where are you going, Frutti? Oh, shoot. Captain Obvious. Whoa, whoa. What are these tanks? We got to figure out what the deal is. I'm it. No, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Oh, we want to go over there. There we go. So like right. We go through these. Are we going to get trapped in here? I'm hearing a lot of gun fights out here. I'd like to get out of here. All right, let's get the smoke in. I don't want anybody to see this. So he's going to ditch the tank now to go on foot. Nice shots. All right. The takes cool, but controls are a little funky on the. Oh, OK. We're done with the tank. All right. Well, hit it. Nice. Clean shots right there. Starting to figure out the sniper a little more. Obviously, that range a little bit more doable. Got that legendary M4 as well. Taking out Tony. Nice, easy shots. Four players remain looking to get above 10 kills on the mouse and keyboard right here. And it's definitely very, very possible. Pretty big zone left as well. I think some shots to his left could provide another easy kill. Get back to back. I might as well. We're back to back the two time. One versus one. Maybe he is the Bush. You know, he wants to hit. Oh, he's not going to go for the 360. Come on, Doc. Come on, Doc. Give us the entertainment. See ya. Look how much content there is. I mean, just look how much is going on. I could see how you could just get sink right into this, man. If you're a mobile gamer, this is probably like paradise. Huh? It's got to be. You got so much content to work with. Because I think this was a good starting point, but this wasn't really a real test. This was like a good gauge for what can Doc do on mobile? What can Ferg do on PC? I think Doc has a lot further to go on mobile than Ferg has to go on PC. And I think maybe if we crossed a couple different games as well, we could get a better idea. Had an absolute blast watching this. Don't get me wrong. This was super, super fun. But I think if we can get these guys on an equal playing field, like you said, money on the line. I would Doc is fully in it when he got when he knows what his setting needs to be when he knows hit the control button. I think it could be something absolutely insane. So we're in Doc's going to grow up. He's going to put in the time and maybe I'm creating a fake event, but I would love it. What about a rematch? Possibility. Anyways, champs, I'd like to think once again, Activision, Call of Duty Mobile, brand new content released on both Warzone and mobile. I got to be honest, man. For a mobile game. That's a lot of fun. All right, champs, enjoy the rest of your day. Wednesday. Let's get after it. Let's get back into the Warzone. Let's get dialed in. Let's play 240 Hertz. Let's play on our 3D. 40 Hertz, let's play on our three inch or three 42 inch monitors. Like let's get the brand new top of the line rocket mouse and keyboard. The Turtle Beach headset right in the on this on this thousand dollar desk that goes up and down on a mouse pad that is very specific in terms of the texture in the field and LED lights that go all the way around the mouse pad and the go XLR mic that's plugged in directly to my stream deck that goes into my third PC and fucking monitor like champs. Let's wake up. Let's wake up for Wednesday and have a good night. I'm pulling for Doc. I mean, I don't know him that well, but I did cast with him recently and he seems like a stand up guy, but Doc is one of the few people that I look up to and admire. I don't find a lot of people funny. I don't. It's a curse. And he is one person that cracks me up. He kills me. His production values and everything that goes into the character. And just thinking about like there may have been someone before him, but someone that's kind of dived into an alter ego like in that capacity and live streaming, it's it's kind of brilliant when you really think about it, like brilliant. Yeah, absolutely.
