 So tell me, Doctor, what is the primary motivation for Doctor Disrespect in 2021? Revenge. And we're just. Getting started. Escape from Tarkov. Hey guys. That we hit 4 billion followers on Twitch. Come on, I'm not gonna look at this last guy. You know what I mean? Warzone. A brand new free to play battle royale experience. Remember ladies and gentlemen, 11 AM Pacific Standard Time tomorrow morning. Doctors making a big announcement. Doc, we are about to fucking shred these idiots. Woooo! I saw a lot of grown man giggling. Timmy? Hey man, you wanna play bro? We'll get through this, OK? Doctor Disrespect out of nowhere being banned today, a permanent Twitch ban. Yeah, I don't know chat. When I was talking to Doc, he just said all he said was he was talking to Twitch to figure out what happened. That's it. I see Doctor Disrespect as a friend. I've talked to him throughout this situation. We've texted here and there. I think he's one of the best entertainers on the internet. What has happened to Doctor D? Banned off of a platform that he's dedicated so much time to. I feel like we're getting closer and closer to something. It's out of my hands. Something historical. But I'm still in control. But it's gonna change us. It's out of my hands. More so than any other point in my life. You can never take away the power of my soul. We started 11 years ago here on YouTube and boy oh boy oh boy does it feel good to be back. Is it? It's working! What's going on, Stu? Get this shit where we get started. Disrespect. Do you have time to buy? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm literally the best type in the world. Oh my God. OBJ, baby. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce you my memoir. No! What the fuck is this game about? What is it about? That's true. I mean you're way older than me, bro. Come on. Come on! I call that. I call that. That's a 360 into a face mask put on snipe shot. Let's go! Let's go, baby. I ain't go legs down, doc. You ain't let down nobody, man. I dreamt of this moment my whole life. To be pushed back, to be threatened into extinction. You can't simply define something you cannot comprehend. In this new delicate world, Dr. Disrespect and the Champions Club. They've been levitating, separated by being above in the mindset while others scramble below, lost in the day to day struggles of relevancy. We don't have time for that. Too strong, too much energy, too much natural ability to be held back. In 2021, ain't nothing gonna hold us back, Champions Club.
