Thank you for the $4.99 doc Timmy so bad I mean like even Timmy hack but he's so bad at video games that his hacks are just Almost obsolete like they just they don't matter Today's one of these days. Oh All right. Today's one of these fucking days baby. Oh get me inside Didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't Come on, come on, come on. Boom. Did I did it? Collapse Oh, look at that. What's that? Oh boy, that was really tough. Put on a real fucking battle right there, man. I'm feeling good today. I'm not gonna lie. I'm feeling good today. I hope Timmy fucking brings us a game today, man. Okay, I can't be carrying them all the time. I got a feeling today's gonna be a big carry day by the two times and then I'm gonna get frustrated. I'm gonna get impatient with him. One little peek, one little peeky-poo. That's all I wanted. Let's bring out my sniper. What? That's a good shot. Can I get to the ship? He has one stem. The Omega. I've never been on the ship, so I don't know if this is a good move or not. Okay, two people just dropped. Oh, that's huge actually. If he can get that. No, he missed the shot. 1v1, v1. I guess we just pray this guy doesn't see him out here. I mean, this is risky. Oh, he's on the... What the fuck is that? Come on, Doc. Hit it, bro. Oh my god. I already knocked you. Already fucking won. Like, I won the game. I knocked your ass. You peeked. I knocked you. You had self-revive and solos. Braindead fucking game design, man. You know, get this game on a new team. Already knocked that guy. I already killed that guy once. You know what I mean? I knocked his ass down. I mean, he has a point. Is he wrong? Right? Am I going to troll him and say all he had to do was hit the shot on the guy that was knocked? Is that too far right now? I think he's going to be angry. I'm already tired of Timmy's little whiny attitude. Aren't you guys? This little pussy whiny attitude. I can already feel it. I can already hear it in my head. Doc, I haven't played in five days. Five days. No bullshit. Okay, so. Oh, you're going to be locked in then. Yeah, I think we'll be good. Guys, one shot across. I'm going to drop down. What the hell? I guess that time. Yeah, I mean, that was just bad timing. I'm coming down brother. You all right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. This guy's... Tippity-toppity. Halfway up or yeah? Oh, he's one! Just one shot! Actually, what do you fuck with me, boy? Oh my God, man. Are you just going to float all day, Timmy? I was literally flying back down to you. Listen, I don't want to get into the blame game today. So, you know, let's stay strong minded. I agree. But first game of the day, we get a win? I mean, Whips is making bullshit tweets like, oh, should we play Warzone all day? Yeah, I didn't really appreciate that. I might fire him. There's people down below, so I wouldn't go down. God. God. Oh, fuck it. That's my fault. I really thought he was going to swing that. Fuck it, just do a lock on him. I can't see this guy. I can't see him! I can't see him! Can you see him? Can you fucking see him? How do you... How does he... I knew he was going to do that. No! Well, you died. Yeah, you got died. You died. And then you let me die by... Well, you died when we had lowdown. We were like crying. Sorry, I can't hear you. The plane, the plane. I can't hear you. All right, man. We turn it up. Well, you died when we had lowdown. You talk about gutter trash, the bottom of the barrel rat infested scum. And I don't care if he's 11, 12 years old. I don't care. I think one of my favorite comments that you made, it was when a kid was stream sniping you and you go, these fucking 10 year olds stream sniping me on a Monday. Go get a job. Oh, that is just... That fucking comment, dude, that was comedy. You're pretty funny, dude. You ever consider stand up comedy? No, I sit down all day. What's... No, how's it go, Timmy? You would do stand up comedy, but you prefer to sit. Got it. Got it. I'll have to remember that. All right. Get it up! Get that thing up right now, baby! Come on! Wow! Get it up! Yeah! I don't know what the fuck you're doing, Timmy. Like, I don't know. I'm gonna believe it out of here. I have no idea what you're doing, man. Why aren't you on me? You didn't say anything! Why? I mean, why aren't you on me? Why would I be on you if I don't need to be? We need fucking money, right? You don't say dick, not stick! I got four kills. How many fucking kills do you got? You got one, man. Holy shit. Look at you. Holy shit. Yeah, look at this guy. I don't know who you're fighting. I got zero info. That's your teammate. Then you get mad, dude. That's fucking crazy. Hit one bullet. My life is falling. I'm gonna get shot more from my left. Does that make sense? Right here. This is the second person that he's got left. You lost the 1v1 to the guy I had a bullet? No, I just ran into a team of two that are slide canceling through the door into my interior. Playing trio! You got me on this level of energy now for yelling at me when you died. I just don't know what the hell you are doing. There's people below me. There's people flying in on me. I don't know that! I got zero information! The guy is down below. That's the only guy that I saw and I fucking called him out. And that's the one guy I saw. You don't tell me fucking anything about anyone being on you at all. So what am I gonna do? I'm gonna go get fucking loot. Listen, Jeep Cherokee it. Right? Jeep Cherokee it. Oh my god. Oh, holy fuck. Listen, Jeep Cherokee it. You brought this energy. You yelled at me for your death. You're the one that agreed to the triple threat challenge. You agreed to the triple threat challenge. This is part of it, Timmy. Wake the fuck up. I'm awake. I'm fucking here. You're not awake. You're down below in the volcano looting by yourself. And I've got guys landing on me one at a time. One at a time. Two guys up the fucking sift. Boom, boom, boom. Right? Right. You just want me to hold your fucking hand? Hold some accountability for your actions, right? How can you leave yourself looking for the fuck? You are not doing anything if you don't want to win. Holy shit! Sometimes you got to go outside and get some fresh air. When Timmy's, bro, low key, bro, I'm landing on you, bro. I'm at peak, bro, bro, bro, bro. And there I am, shredded, ripped out of my mind. The sun hit me just at the right angle. Getting the job done, kill after kill. Guys zipping up the zip line. People trying to jump on my helicopter and I'm still in full control. I mean, Timmy, you suck. Hey, bro, I got to go get my low key, bro. I'll be right back. Hey, Chad, I'll be back. Low key, bro, I'll be back. W. I can do it. You are not Japanese. You are not a Tanaka. You're a bitch. We're happy to have you. I don't want to be killed by a Tiki. So, I'm going to be a... I'm going to be a... I don't give a shit. I'll let you fly down to me. Getting shot at. I like getting shot at like you need me getting shot at. I could try another one. Stay in this fight. I got an ego. I got a nasty ego. He's one shot. Oh my. More plates on the by. I might take this fucking chopper and put it down his throat, if I'm honest. Alright Doc, fucking cover me. One behind us now, full time. I'm your fucking hargoloo. You stuck me. Ah! This game's ass! Bro, these planes can literally suck my fucking ball sack. No, no, no bullshit. I'm about to get into that fight. I'm about to jump in. What do I get? Off the fucking top rope. Right. Right as I'm about to get into it. All it does is just fuck with me, right? And then this guy goes pale. I'll fucking throw him out right there. Yeah, alright. Throws the thermite. What do I do? Fucking catch it. Cause I'm a fat bitch. I need, like this is, I knew you couldn't handle the triple threat challenge. I just knew it. I can break my keyboard. I know. See? That's what I'm at. I just want to keep, I have a spare, you know? Like I have an extra. So, you know, just fucking, you know what I mean? You know, honestly, what do you want me to do? I guess that's the better question. I mean, at this point, anything, you know? Cause you haven't done anything. All right. I'll take care of it. Ready? Me and Doc are running around Caldera. Doing the triple threat challenge. Having fun. Playing with each other. We're running two hours into win. Doc is really thin. He's got a guy in front of him. And he be... GAAAHHHHH! He shoots first and the guy runs. But it doesn't matter cause he's a bum. Planned kits is full. But forgets the money. Keeps the money. Another time in... And there's another, there's another team. Another two. Having fun. We're playing in Caldera. Ooh Caldera! We're playing in Caldera. Ooh Caldera! I am not having, I am not having fun with you right now. All right. Yeah. All that makes one of us. Yeah. I just want to, I want to be, I want to highlight that. I'm not having fun because I feel like you've given up. I feel like the, I feel like the triple threat challenge and I talked to my community before, before we started today. Like I had a lot of question marks around whether or not you were able to compete at the highest level to complete this triple threat challenge. And it's, it's already showing that you're, you're a little, you're a little weak. You're weak. Mike Skarn with a 99, 99. Doc, I'm three weeks post-surgery on my arm and I'm already stronger, faster, vane-ier with a jawline that will slice and cut your entire family all bank to you and the champions club. I'm running out of fingers. Holy shit. Woo! That's a patent. I got this move patent pending. It's patent pending, Mike. It's patent pending. Doc, my fiance is 20 weeks along with our first boy. Any advice for a first time dad? This is Josh Carroll with a 9 99. Yeah. I'm going to build a Formula 1, uh, like little water bed in the shape of a Formula 1 car. You put sound effects, build it, like with LED lights and like the little cockpit and stuff like that. I'm sure you'll have fun sleeping in that thing.
