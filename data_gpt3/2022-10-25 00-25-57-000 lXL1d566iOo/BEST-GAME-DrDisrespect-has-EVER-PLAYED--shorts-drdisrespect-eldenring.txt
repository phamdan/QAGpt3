 and there's a couple of diamonds in the rough. That's for sure. Elden Ring was one of them for me. It's one of the best games I've ever played, man. That was such a sick experience. I'm so glad I got to experience Elden Ring. I put that definitely in one of my top games of all time, for sure. From world design to the amount of freedom and choice and then the level of discoverability, it was just amazing. Like that right there is true. That's a creative eye for a game, and I love that shit, man.
