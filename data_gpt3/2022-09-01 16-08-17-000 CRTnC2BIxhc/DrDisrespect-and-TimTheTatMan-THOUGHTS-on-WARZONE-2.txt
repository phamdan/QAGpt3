 I hope Raven's not on Warzone 2. They need a new studio. They need a new studio cycled in on this game. They really do, man. Hopefully, fingers crossed, Modern Warfare 2 is good. I hope it is, man. But more so, Warzone 2 is good. Because if Raven's building Warzone 2, you might as well chalk it right now. I mean, they've done... No, they haven't. No, they haven't. Yes, they have. They haven't. A little bit. No, those guys over there are... No. If I was Activision, I'd be like, Treyarch, we want you to build the next battle royale experience for Call of Duty. You know, I feel like it needs to dramatically shift in terms of its personality, its look, its fiction, whatever it is, right? But like, the gameplay needs to shift. That's what was cool about going from Blackout to Warzone. It felt like there was a very strong contrast between the two styles of games, right? And the studios that were involved. Now that Raven's sort of taken on Warzone and supported it, and then Caldera and all that shit, like... And if they support Warzone 2, we're just gonna get more of the same shit, man. That's all I'm saying. I don't know, but when you got a snapshot grenade that just highlights you through the fucking walls, like, let's get rid of that cheesy-ass shit, please. For the next Warzone. Thoughts on that, Timmy? How about the bullets? Like, when you get tagged by a bullet, they see you for five seconds running through walls? Can we get rid of those things? Infinity Ward made the original Warzone, right? They did. And they didn't have that stuff in there. I know. I would like to think... You know what I mean? That... Going back to Infinity Ward being, like, over Warzone. I don't think Infinity Ward's gonna be managing Warzone 2, though. They're all about the campaign and multiplayer, right? They don't have enough there at that studio to... I mean... No, I think it is Infinity Ward over Warzone 2. I think. Is it not? Dude, I have a hard time thinking it. I was under the assumption that Infinity Ward was in charge of Warzone 2. That was my assumption. I have a hard time seeing that, unless they... Chat, is Warzone 2... Infinity Ward's in charge of it, correct? I mean, I would love to see Dead Silence go. There's a lot of things I would love to see go. Don't get me wrong. Yes, they are making it. People are just saying, yes, they are making it. They don't even know what the hell they're talking about. Listen, Infinity Ward probably has... Now I'm gonna guess. I'm gonna guess. This is me kind of guessing. I could be wrong. So just take it for what it is. But like, I'm thinking they probably have 150 to 200 devs just at that studio alone, right? And if you think about the massive undertaking a single-player campaign is, I mean, that was like 60-70% of Sledgehammer Games' studio and effort was put into the single-player campaign, right? We had a small multiplayer team, and when we built our game, Advanced Warfare, the multiplayer aspect, we did it alongside with the help of Raven as well, right? There's like this, but we owned it. The way I look at it, man, in terms of all the resources they have, it's a lot of it's gonna be put into the single-player campaign, and a lot of it's gonna be put into the multiplayer campaign. I have a hard time thinking like they also have a dedicated team at Infinity Ward that's all in on Warzone. But I could be wrong. I just don't... I'd be wrong. Because I thought, and I figured that that is what... Because they were the ones that made the original Warzone, so I would think that they would be in charge of Warzone 2. I guess we'll find out. Yep, and I'm usually right, Jimmy. Just want to clarify that. Yeah, sometimes. From Activision's financial support release development on this year's premium Warzone experiences is being led by Activision's renowned Infinity Ward studio. That's a quote. Yeah, yeah, but like they never list the... They always list the leading studio and then they'll list all the other supporting studios. But they'll never define who works on what, like directly. I mean they might have in the past, but like not as like part of the marketing. Yeah, see here's the thing with the DMZ mode that they're talking about. What makes Escape from Tarkov is kind of like the entire package. It's not just one thing. It's not one element. It's how they built everything. The larger scope of this game mode. And how it all plays into the looting, in terms of the marketplace, in terms of the way your player feels, the different types of equipment and armor, tasks. I mean it's such a hardcore game with an extremely steep learning curve. And there's this progression system associated with your character that's just so... I don't know as like a... In addition to single player and fucking multiplayer and warzone, they're going to make this little side... Like you think this mode's going to... They're going to knock it out of the park? I don't know. I feel like it could happen. People are saying you're muted. Are you muted on your side? Am I getting trolled? Yeah. Hey Alex. I really like you. I really do. No, I'm not going to fire you. No, I think it's a quick cash grab. That's the way I look at it. Unless they hire a dedicated team and they've been working on it for years. They just can't do what Battlefield did. You know? Where they hyped it up, escaped from Tarkov mode. And man, that thing was something else. Just to give you an idea of what I think they could do with DMZ. Let's say you play DMZ, right? And you can get... There's like a rare... This is just totally off the top of my head, right? There's a rare camo that only spawns once every 10,000 DMZs, right? And you can pick the camo up and try to like evac with it. Throw that in air quotes. And then you get that camo for all your guns across multiplayer, warzone, stuff like that. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's just like an idea that I think if they tune it that way, it could be really rewarding. Because it's like, holy shit, I got the camo. You know what I mean? I got to get out. And then you're like, holy shit, I have to get out with this. Then you finally get out and you can flex it. You have that one in 10,000 camo. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's how I'm looking at it. I just don't know if Call of Duty will see it that way. Fuck, will you ever play Blackout again? Jesus Christ. Is the air control... Is it still on? I thought they like shut the servers off. No, man. The problem is they didn't have cross play. So the PC community lost real fat. Like we lost the PC community real fast. Like I couldn't play mouse and keyboard anymore. You had to play on PlayStation. Blackout was more fun than Warzone, man. I'm going to say it, Timmy. I mean, you saw Formals comment. I did not. I will say I love the Warzone looting system over the Blackout looting system. Well, of course. Yeah. And then there's some argument about the armor system as well. Right. And I do love Warzone's armor system. The plates, I fucking like that a lot. But the actual gameplay... The actual gameplay movement and the way the weapons are. I don't know, man. Blackout was so much more fun. It was like the Turbo Edition. If you ever watch Blackout, like a montage of... It'll look like you're watching Call of Duty Turbo Edition. It was so fast and athletic and grapple and stuff. It's cool, man. It's just something about firing up Escape from Tarkov that I just love. So grab your popcorn. We're just getting started. I've got hot, and I mean, drippy, acidic, goosebump-driven diarrhea spitting out. And I'll be back. God, I'm looking good! Let's start off with a little scav run, shall we? I'm dead. Would you give me the prompt? Thank you. I already got a couple of those. I don't need that. Car battery? Let's get the hell out of here, man. Not yet, not yet, not yet. But you have so much to teach. Would you hit the... Thank you. Let's go Flawless today. No deaths today. None. We got one more bin to check though. Just one, okay? Not that big of a deal, Jamp. Just one. I know, I know. Couldn't help myself. Just like that, man. Nice. I mean, relatively packed. Extraction, we got a car battery, we're good. I like it. I haven't run across a battery in a long time. What the hell am I? Oh shit. Okay. Get locked in here. What you doing up there? Stop! Get fucking get, open the fucking door! Open the door! Open the door! Holy shit! Hello? Hi. No, mom. No, I'm not playing the game right now. I'm doing my homework. Hey. Look at me. Look at me. How you doing? Just a scab here. Hi. What you doing out there? What you doing outside? Why you crouch right there? Why you in the bushes? Why you crouching around? Why you gonna accept this grenade going right through that window in two, one? Oh, God. Game's such a fucking heavy mess. Such an unathletic heavy mess. That's what it is.
