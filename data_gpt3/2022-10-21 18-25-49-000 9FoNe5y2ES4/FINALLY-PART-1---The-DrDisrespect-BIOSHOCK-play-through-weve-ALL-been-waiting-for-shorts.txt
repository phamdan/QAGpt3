 Part one of Bioshock's playthrough. Oh yeah, there it is. I don't want to be like super fast. I'm not playing a competitive shooter game here. I'm trying to... Oh, guess we're going down. Get to higher ground. Boom! Boom! We'll take that. Why do they get a load of me? Plasmids collected! Static discharge! Right. Thank you. You're welcome. Just stick with me now. Stay with me. Stay with me. Let me just collect some stuff. I'm gonna rescue you again! Rescue you again? Look right behind ya! I kinda don't know what's going on. What the hell? Doc, is this your first ever playthrough? You played it back in the day. It's the first time I ever played it. We love you! Jump. Boom. Played a lot of Call of Duty. Trying to think where I need to go. We're trying to find the mayor of the city. And we need to suffocate him in this world. That's pretty much all I know. Let's go find... Gotta find these. Follow me. Let's go find the demonic child. How do I know what I'm doing? You're close to being done. Next stream, we finish it. Four to five hours. That would be perfect.
